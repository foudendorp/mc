Now we’re expanding that offering to Microsoft 365 Copilot app on desktop and the web, as well as in the Microsoft 365 apps, starting with Word and PowerPoint on desktop and web and Outlook on desktop, web, and mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>Voice enables Microsoft 365 Copilot users to have natural, back-and-forth conversations with Copilot simply by speaking.
