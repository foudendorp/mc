Previously, these sessions were closed after 36 minutes of inactivity.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nThe automatic time-out threshold for inactive agent sessions is being reduced from 36 minutes, down to 15 minutes. This change will enhance service performance and improve analytics by making data from inactive sessions available sooner. <br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nIf your custom agent(s) include rules that trigger actions after a period of inactivity, be sure to update the inactivity duration to match the new timeout threshold. <br><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
