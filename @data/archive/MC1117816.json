These changes aim to reduce friction during same-device sign-ins and make it easier for users to get started with the app.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): </b>We will begin rolling out in <b>mid-September 2025</b> and expect to complete by<b> late September to early October 2025</b>.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Streamlined same-device number matching</p><ul><li>Today, users signing in on the same mobile device as their Microsoft Authenticator app often encounter a blocker: the notification appears over the sign-in screen, hiding the number they need to enter. This forces them to tap <b>“I can’t see the number”</b> to proceed.\n</li><li>With this update, that friction is removed. Users will no longer be required to enter a number when signing in on the same device. Instead, they’ll simply confirm the sign-in by tapping <b>Yes</b> or <b>No</b>.\n</li><li>On <b>Android</b>, all same-device sign-in flows will support this streamlined experience. No number entry required.</li><li>On<b> iOS</b>, users will also benefit from this change. When the SSO extension is involved, users will still need to switch to the Authenticator app to complete the sign-in, but number entry will not be required.\n</li><li>Users signing in from a different device will continue to use number matching as usual.</li></ul><p>Improved First Run Experience (FRX)</p><ul><li>The updated FRX consolidates privacy screens and prioritizes adding a <b>Microsoft Entra account</b> over a personal Microsoft account.\n</li><li>The <b>“Scan a QR code”</b> option will also be more prominently displayed to simplify account setup.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>No admin action is required. These changes will roll out automatically as users update their Microsoft Authenticator app.</p><p></p>\n<p><b>Compliance considerations </b></p><p>No known compliance impacts. Please review internally to ensure alignment with your organization's policies.</p>",
