Beginning <b>November 30, 2025</b>, the <i>logic.azure.com</i> URL will no longer work- meaning the flows will not trigger when invoked from external systems.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>To ensure that existing flows using HTTP or Teams Webhook triggers continue to work, complete the actions mentioned in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12527_3\">this documentation</a> by <b>November 30, 2025</b>. Prior to this date, both the old and new URLs will be supported. If no action is taken before this date to update flow triggers to the new URL, users will experience failures triggering these flows as the old URL will no longer work.",
