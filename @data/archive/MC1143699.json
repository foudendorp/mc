    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to standardize security role and system application docs in Microsoft Dataverse. This feature will reach general availability on September 30, 2025. <br> <br> \n<b>How does this affect me </b><br> \nWith this feature, users, admins, and non-admins can easily find Microsoft Dataverse security roles and their respective privileges in the documentation or by asking Microsoft Copilot in Bing. The Microsoft Learn site automatically documents these roles and applications with standard and consistent content. Customers can use Copilot in Bing to find the list of privileges in a security role and see the differences between security roles without asking a local admin to access a Dataverse environment. <br> <br> \n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br> \nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required. <br> <br> \nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/11688/standardize-security-role-system-application-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Standardize security role and system application docs</a>.",
