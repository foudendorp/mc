These enhancements will take effect on <b>December 1, 2025</b>.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nCurrently, certain audit events may include details that could potentially reveal sensitive information when columns with security restrictions were created or updated. Following these enhancements, these specific events will now be protected, and the before-and-after column values will be filtered in activity logs. You may notice changes in the granularity of audit event data for operations involving column-level security. <br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required. <br><br>\nFor more information about Column-level security, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/13274/field-level-security\" target=\"_blank\">Column-level security to control access</a>.",
