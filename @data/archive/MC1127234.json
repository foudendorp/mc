    "Content": "<p>Updated October 28, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Disclaimer: The original message center post was published on August 1, 2025. We previously stated that this is a new feature when it is an expanded capability of the existing feature memory in Copilot. This expanded capability requires new processing of users' data, which is outlined below. We have edited the content below for accuracy and clarity. Thank you to the customers who provided feedback over the past few weeks. We have adjusted our roadmap to address your needs and concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting September 1, 2025, Microsoft 365 Copilot will start remembering key highlights from your person-to-person communications in chats, emails, and meetings. Initially these memories will be used to improve the quality of Copilot responses to people-related questions. These memories are private to the user. This feature is available to Copilot-licensed enterprise users.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=499153\" target=\"_blank\"> 499153</a></p><div>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b></p>\n<ul><li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b>&nbsp;Rollout begins early September 2025 and is expected to complete by late January 2026 (previously late October 2025).&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>Copilot builds user memory by using AI to analyze and summarize digital communications—such as emails, chats, and meeting transcripts—to build a live memory of key highlights. This enables Copilot to deliver more personalized and context-aware responses in Copilot chat across Microsoft 365 apps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Communication memory uses AI to analyze and summarize digital communications—such as emails, chats, and meeting transcripts—to build a live memory of key highlights. This enables Copilot to deliver more personalized and context-aware responses across Microsoft 365 apps. \n</p><p>Unlike existing personalization features that operate within a single app (e.g., Outlook, Teams Recap, or Facilitator), communication memory provides a unified view across communication channels. Summaries are generated by large language models (LLMs) and may occasionally be inaccurate; each memory includes source links for user review. \n</p><p>This feature is on by default for Copilot-licensed users.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>What you can do to prepare</b></p>\n<p>Admins can manage memory in Copilot through the Enhanced Personalization admin control, available via Microsoft Graph. Disabling Enhanced Personalization will turn off all Copilot memory and personalization features across your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Question</th>\n      <th>Answer</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Does the change store new customer data, if so, where, and is the data cached or permanently stored?</td>\n      <td>Copilot stores AI-generated summaries based on user-accessible communications (e.g., emails, chats, meetings).
