For customers enrolled in hotpatch quality update policies, <b>when</b> the upgrade is taken can affect whether devices continue to receive hotpatch updates during the current hotpatch cycle. Devices that upgrade during a designated <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/manage/windows-autopatch-hotpatch-updates#release-cycles\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">baseline release period</a> (such as October) will remain eligible for hotpatching. Devices that upgrade during a non-baseline month (such as November) will temporarily stop receiving hotpatch updates and, until the next baseline release (e.g., January 2026), will instead receive standard security updates that require a restart.</div><div><br></div><div><b>When will this happen:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>The Windows 11, version 25H2 upgrade will be offered starting <b>September 30, 2025</b>, with <b>October 2025</b> designated as the baseline month for hotpatch eligibility.
