    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to reassign an agent's owner with PowerShell in Microsoft Copilot Studio. This feature will reach general availability on October 30, 2025.  \n<br><br>\n \n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature lets you manage agents when the original owner leaves or changes roles. Admins with the Tenant admin, Power Platform administrator, or Dynamics 365 Service Administrator roles can use PowerShell commands to assign new owners to agents. The new owner needs a Copilot Studio license and must be a member of the environment where the agent is.<br><br>\nWhen an admin changes the owner of an agent, the new owner:<ol>\n<li>Gets access to all the agent's components with standard owner permissions, including delete permissions.</li>\n<li>Gets the Environment Maker security role for the environment where the agent exists.</li>\n</ol>\nThe previous owner loses access to the agent. The change doesn't affect other co-owners.<br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit the <a href=\" https://aka.ms/ADO10205-1\"target=\"_blank\">Reassign an agent's owner with PowerShell</a> article.",
