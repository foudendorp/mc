    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>To help organizations better protect sensitive files in transit, we're introducing a public preview for extending <b>Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies to the network through integration with Entra Global Secure Access Internet Access</b>. Through this integration, organizations can intercept and inspect file traffic at the network layer and enforce actions based on DLP policy conditions. It helps prevent sensitive files from being shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, apps, APIs, add-ins, and more—including generative AI platforms, cloud storage, and content-sharing services—while managing alerts and incidents through Purview and Microsoft Defender.</p><p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=522096\" target=\"_blank\">522096</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Public preview: </b>Rollout begins mid-November 2025 and completes by mid-December 2025.</li>\n<li><b>General availability: </b>Rollout begins mid-June 2026 and completes by mid-July 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b style=\"\">Who is affected: </b>Microsoft 365 tenants with E3 or E5 licenses; Admins managing Microsoft Purview DLP and Entra Global Secure Access.</li>\n<li><b style=\"\">What will happen:\n  </b><ul>\n    <li>A new “Inline Web Traffic” scenario will be available in Purview DLP policy creation.</li>\n    <li>Admins can configure granular policies and rules to detect and protect sensitive files transmitted to over 35,000 unmanaged cloud applications.</li>\n    <li>Policy matches, alerts, and incidents will be managed centrally in Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender.</li>\n    <li>The feature will be available by default but requires configuration to activate.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your GSA administrator configures the following in Entra Global Secure Access:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Enabled the internet access traffic profile and ensure the correct user assignments apply.</li>\n    <li>Configure TLS inspection and configure a TLS inspection policy.</li><li>Create a file policy and add a rule that specifies the action \"Scan with Purview\".</li><li>Configure a security profile with the above policies and link it to a conditional access policy.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your global admin must activate Purview pay-as-you-go to enable this capability.
