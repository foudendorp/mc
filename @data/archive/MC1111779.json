    "Content": "<p>Updated July 18, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We’re enhancing the Community Expert experience in Viva Engage by introducing a self-nomination feature. This empowers community members to express interest in becoming experts, streamlining the process for admins and encouraging broader participation.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability rollout begins early July 2025 and is expected to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>A new “Request to be an expert” link will appear in the membership panel of Viva Engage communities for members who are not already community admins or experts. When clicked, users will see a description of the expert role and can submit a request.\n</p><p>Community admins will receive a notification and can review pending requests directly from the membership panel. A new toggle—enabled by default—allows admins to disable the self-nomination option for their community if desired.\n</p><p>This update encourages community engagement while giving admins full control over expert nominations.</p><p><i>Request to be an expert:</i></p><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/bf071600-52dc-4c94-b105-19d0bd8a9423\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><i>Information to requester:&nbsp;</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/c206fec3-05f4-444b-8e00-a9b9f34a049f\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><i>Review expert request for community admin:</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/eaee1f8e-07d2-4aad-9485-7e7482e543bb\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><i>Approval and denial for community admins:</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0a1f2473-f746-4bec-9393-3fa104e885eb\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>No tenant-level action is required.
