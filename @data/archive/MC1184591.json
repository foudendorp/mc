    "Content": "As part of our Secure Future Initiative (SFI), the tenant isolation feature will be enabled by default for all Power Platform tenants as the new default behavior. The enforcement is scheduled to begin in <b>February 2026.</b><br><br>This feature applies only to Power Platform policies and is separate from guest access policies and Azure tenant restriction features. <br><br><b>How does this affect me? </b><br>Tenant isolation only applies to connectors running within a tenant. The default tenant isolation behavior will block all connection attempts from one tenant to another; inbound (connections to the tenant from external tenants), outbound (connections from the tenant to external tenants), or both (inbound – outbound) will be blocked by Power Platform.<br><br>Communications within the same tenant will not be affected. In addition, users who sign in as guests (guest user access) will remain unaffected.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare? </b><br> This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>For more information and to learn how to configure a tenant isolation policy, please review the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/13103\">Cross-tenant inbound and outbound restrictions</a> documentation.",
