    "Content": "<p>Updated September 5, 2025: Access to emails by typing '/' in the prompt box will only be available when using Copilot Chat in Outlook. This applies to both the full app and side pane experience.</p><p>We're enhancing Copilot Chat for users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license with new capabilities that make it easier for them to include work content—such as files and emails—in their prompts when using Chat in Web scope. By typing ‘/’ in the prompt box, users can quickly search and reference relevant files or emails, streamlining prompt creation and improving Copilot responses. Additionally, some suggested prompts beneath the input box will now include relevant files or emails to help users get started quickly.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/e6d7449f-abbc-4ee6-b2b3-0b9f4c2a127a/2f8c1d1ae924ab9dd9b1edf74689e47553383208.png\" style=\"width: 25%;\"><br></p><p>Note: Web scope in Copilot Chat is still grounded only in the web. Users can also choose to include additional content in the prompt for Copilot to reason over, such as with the methods described above. Users must switch to Work scope to have Chat automatically grounded in content from their organization’s graph or their personal graph.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=500377\" target=\"_blank\">500377</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><ul><li><b>Files:</b> Currently available (Roadmap ID 497112)\n</li><li><b>Emails: </b>Rollout begins mid-September 2025 and completes by late September 2025 (Roadmap ID 500377)</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This update improves usability and prompt relevance in Copilot Chat by allowing users to reference files and emails in their prompts (without uploading them manually) or as part of suggested prompts under the input box.
