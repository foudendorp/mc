    "Content": "<p>We're enhancing Copilot Chat for users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license with new capabilities that make it easier for them to include work content—such as files and emails—in their prompts when using Chat in Web scope. By typing ‘/’ in the prompt box, users can quickly search and reference relevant files or emails, streamlining prompt creation and improving Copilot responses. Additionally, some suggested prompts beneath the input box will now include relevant files or emails to help users get started quickly.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0d4402da-507a-4b7d-bbab-26cbc0fa2551 \" width=\"400\" height=\"\">\n</p><p>Note: Web scope in Copilot Chat is still grounded only in the web. Users can also choose to include additional content in the prompt for Copilot to reason over, such as with the methods described above.
