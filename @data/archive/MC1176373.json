This feature will reach general availability on October 23, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nThis feature introduces a new Microsoft 365 Admin Center control that allows tenant admins to restrict which makers can share declarative agent links with their entire organization from Copilot Studio Lite. <br><br>\nAdmins can set org-wide sharing permissions to: <ul>\n<li>All users (default) </li>\n<li>No users</li>\n<li>Define an allow-list of specific users and/or groups</li></ul>\nIf the required permissions are not met, the Copilot Studio lite sharing control disables the <i>Anyone in your organization</i> sharing option, with tooltips explaining the restriction to the maker. Attempts to update the agent or share it more widely are blocked until the agent’s sharing setting meets the admin-defined sharing policy. <br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
