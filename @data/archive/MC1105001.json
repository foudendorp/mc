    "Content": "<p>To improve performance and reliability, we have scheduled planned maintenance for the Windows 365 service. This maintenance will occur during non-peak hours, based on the Client Deviceâ€™s local time zone, to minimize potential impact on your organization. For organizations with users across multiple regions, we recognize that non-peak hours may vary. Maintenance will take place separately in each region, affecting only users connecting from that location during the scheduled time. The times listed below indicate the actual maintenance start times for each region, not adjusted for different time zones.\n</p><p>During this period, there will be no service downtime. Users are expected to experience little to no disruption.\n</p><p><b>Maintenance Schedule:\n</b></p><ul><li>Start Date: July 7, 2025\n</li><li>End Date: July 12, 2025\n</li></ul><p>Daily Maintenance Window Start Times:\n</p><ul><li>Africa: 23:00 UTC\n</li><li>Asia Pacific: 16:30 UTC\n</li><li>Australia: 14:00 UTC\n</li><li>Europe: 00:00 UTC\n</li><li>India: 19:30 UTC\n</li><li>North America: 06:00 UTC\n</li><li>South America: 05:00 UTC\n</li></ul><p>Daily Maintenance Window End Times:\n</p><ul><li>Africa: 03:00 UTC\n</li><li>Asia Pacific: 20:30 UTC\n</li><li>Australia: 18:00 UTC\n</li><li>Europe: 04:00 UTC\n</li><li>India: 23:30 UTC\n</li><li>North America: 10:00 UTC\n</li><li>South America: 09:00 UTC\n</li></ul><p><b>How does this affect my organization?</b>\n</p><ul><li>During the maintenance window, users actively connected via UDP relay may experience brief, automatic reconnections, with each disconnection lasting less than a minute.\n</li><li>While the total planned impact duration is up to 4 hours within the maintenance window, disconnections will only occur 1-2 times and will not persist throughout the entire 4-hour period.\n</li><li>Users can establish new connections without impact during the maintenance window.
