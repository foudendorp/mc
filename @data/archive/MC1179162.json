    "Content": "<p>Custom engine agents (CEA) are specialized agentic solutions that can be built using any large language model (LLM), toolchain, or orchestration framework, and are tailored to specific domain or tenant workflows. These agents can be created using either Microsoft Copilot Studio or the Agents Toolkit. File upload support is already available in <i>Microsoft 365 Copilot Business Chat</i>.</p><p>Weâ€™re now extending this capability to Custom engine agents, enabling users to upload files stored locally or in <i>OneDrive</i> directly to agents.
