    "Content": "<div>As the end of support for Windows 10 approaches, Microsoft wants to ensure your organization is well-prepared for the transition to Windows 11. This end of support on October 14, 2025* marks an important step in our mission to provide the most modern and secure computing experience possible. It also reflects our commitment to continually improving Windows security as part of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Secure Future Initiative</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Today we published a new blog post to help you prepare for Windows 10 end of support and outlined options for moving to Windows 11. For details, see<b> </b><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=179154\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">How to prepare for Windows 10 end of support by moving to Windows 11.</a>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>When this will happen:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Starting October 14, 2025, Windows 10 will no longer receive security updates. Information on the purchase of Extended Security Updates (ESU) for organizations of all sizes was previously <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/when-to-use-windows-10-extended-security-updates/ba-p/4102628\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced in April of this year</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>As security threats evolve and adapt, so must our operating systems and hardware. Because of this, we designed Windows 11 to be the most secure version of Windows ever — by default and design — to help you stay ahead of those risks. Advanced security features include hardware-based protection through TPM 2.0, enhanced authentication methods, and virtualization-based security fully enabled by default.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>With 99.7% compatibility with Windows 10 apps**, the move to Windows 11 can be done with the same tools and processes you use today. Organizations can take advantage of a range of tools designed to support this transition, ensuring minimal disruption to your operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Additional information:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>For organizations that need a bit more time before moving to new Windows 11 devices or Copilot+ PCs, as previously announced, an <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">annual Extended Security Updates</a> (ESU) program will be available. Enrolled devices will continue to receive <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/security-update-severity-rating-system?rtc=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">critical and important security updates</a> for Windows 10. However, new features, bug fixes, and technical support will no longer be available from Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b><em>Notes:</em></b><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</div><div><em>*Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) releases are subject to different lifecycle support policies.
