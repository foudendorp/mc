    "Content": "<p>Updated August 29, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows desktop is introducing a new Copilot capability that helps users expand their presentations by generating new topic ideas and slides. This feature ensures that added content matches the look and feel of the existing presentation, enhancing productivity and consistency.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=496137\" target=\"_blank\">496137</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (GA): Rollout will begin in early September 2025 (previously mid-August) for PowerPoint on Windows desktop.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With this update, users can prompt Copilot to generate and insert new topics and slides into their existing presentations. The generated content will maintain the visual style and formatting of the original presentation. Users can initiate this by providing a prompt or referencing a file. A Microsoft 365 license is required to access this feature.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required before the rollout. You may want to inform your users about this new capability and update any relevant training or documentation to reflect the change.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Alters how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed: Maybe - If users reference existing files to generate new content, Copilot may process that data temporarily to generate results. However, it does not change how the data is stored or accessed long-term.</li><li>Introduces or modifies AI/ML capabilities that interact with customer data: Yes - This feature introduces a new generative AI capability that processes user prompts and referenced content to generate slides, directly interacting with customer data.\n</li><li>Provides end users a new way of interacting with generative AI: Yes - Users can now interact with Copilot to generate new presentation content, representing a new generative AI interaction model within PowerPoint.</li></ul>",
