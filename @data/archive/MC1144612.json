    "Content": "This is an update regarding the previous Message Center Post about Dataverse search from April 8th, 2025, which stated that the change would lead to an increase in Dataverse storage capacity consumption for database and file storage on May 12th, 2025.<br><br>This roll out was paused on April 10, 2025.<br><br><b>What is Dataverse search?</b><br>Dataverse search currently supports global searches for all model-driven apps using the \"RelevanceSearch\" index in the Power Platform Admin Center. Going forward, it will include both relevance and semantic indexes, reported as “DataverseSearch”, improving the quality and knowledge experience for agents in Copilot Studio and other Power Platform features.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>As of June 30th, 2025, Dataverse search started to be enabled automatically for all environments that utilize Dataverse search or any of the AI-enabled experiences that use uploaded files or Dataverse tables to ensure business continuity across the platform, subject to Copilot feature availability. The rollout is still in progress. GCC and GCC High regions will be enabled in September. <br><br>All Dataverse indexes will be reported at the <u>Dataverse Database Capacity rate</u>. This change will result in an increase in consumption of storage capacity.<br><br>This is applicable only to Dataverse search and does not turn on any other setting of the experiences that is enabled by Dataverse search.<br><br><b>What are the experiences enabled by Dataverse search?</b><br>Currently, these experiences include:<br><br>Microsoft Copilot Studio Agents<ol style='margin-top: 0px;'><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/1\" target=\"_blank\">Add Files as a knowledge source</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/2\" target=\"_blank\">Add Dataverse as a knowledge source</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/3\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Agent</a></li></ol>Dynamics 365 Copilots<ol start=’4’ style='margin-top: 0px;'><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/4\" target=\"_blank\">Sales Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/5\" target=\"_blank\">Customer Service Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/6\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Center Copilot</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/7\" target=\"_blank\">Field Service Copilot</a></li></ol>Power Apps – Model-Driven Apps<ol start=’8’ style='margin-top: 0px;'><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/8\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot Chat</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/9\" target=\"_blank\">Dataverse search</a></li></ol>Experiences across the Power Platform<ol start=’11’ style='margin-top: 0px;'><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/10\" target=\"_blank\">In Power Apps / Power Automate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/11\" target=\"_blank\">In Microsoft Copilot Studio</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/12\" target=\"_blank\">Power Apps / Power Automate - Custom AI Prompts</a></li></ol>Full list will be kept up to date at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/11898/13\" target=\"_blank\">What is Dataverse search?</a> as the rollout of the enhanced Dataverse search happens, and/or new enabled experiences are added.<br><br><b>How will Dataverse search be reported?</b><br>Storage consumed by Dataverse search is already reported at the Environment level as a table called “RelevanceSearch”.
