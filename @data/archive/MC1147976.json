This change introduces new Microsoft 365 Copilot capabilities that use AI to interact with customer data in SharePoint Online. Copilot can analyze site metadata and permissions to provide task guidance and filtered search results.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change provide end users any new way of interacting with generative AI?</td><td>&nbsp;Yes. Admins can now use natural language queries to interact with Copilot, which responds with step-by-step instructions and filtered site lists based on complex criteria.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities?</td><td>&nbsp;Yes. The multi-variable site search feature helps admins trigger actions and analyze reports that identify oversharing, inactive sites, and other governance risks, making it easier to enforce lifecycle policies and demonstrate compliance.</td></tr><tr><td>Does the change include an admin control and, can it be controlled through Entra ID group membership?</td><td>&nbsp;Yes. Access to these Copilot features can be managed through licensing and Entra ID group membership.</td></tr></tbody></table>",
