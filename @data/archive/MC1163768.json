This feature reached public preview in August 2025. <br><br><b>How does this affect me? </b><br>This feature introduces the <i>Request for Information</i> action, which, when added to an agent flow, enables agents to pause mid-flow and collect missing or critical data directly from users. This reduces flow failures caused by incomplete inputs, eliminates the need for manual restarts, and can ensure that decisions are made with complete, accurate information. The inputs can be in the form of text, numbers, email addresses, binary inputs and more.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
