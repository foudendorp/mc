Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;\n</p><p>\n</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>Microsoft Teams is introducing enhanced protection against phishing attacks by detecting and warning users about malicious URLs shared in Teams chats and channels. This feature helps users make safer decisions before clicking potentially harmful links. This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, Teams for the web, and Teams for iOS/Android.</p><p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=499893\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">499893</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><ul><li>Targeted Release (Worldwide): Rollout begins early September 2025 and is expected to complete by mid-September 2025.</li><li>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout begins early November 2025 and is expected to complete by mid-November 2025.</li></ul><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/affcc91d-3b18-43bc-8141-a4eb69cac958\" style=\"width:400px;\" =\"\"=\"\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p>When a malicious link is detected, Teams will automatically display a warning to both the sender and recipient. This helps reduce the risk of phishing attacks.</p><ul><li>Targeted Release: Link protection is applied only when all participants in the conversation have the feature enabled.</li><li>General Availability: Link protection is enforced if at least one participant in the conversation has the feature enabled.</li></ul><p>Targeted release vs. General Availability behavior:</p><ul><li>Targeted release: Link protection is applied only when all organizations in the conversation have the feature enabled. This feature is <b>off by default</b> and requires admin activation.\n</li><li>General Availability: Link protection is applied if at least one participant has the feature enabled. This feature is <b>on by default</b>. Admin settings saved during Targeted Release will remain unchanged.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare</b></p><p><b>During Public Preview</b>, administrators must manually enable the feature:</p><ol><li>Go to the <i>Teams Admin Center</i></li><li>Navigate to <i>Messaging Settings</i></li><li>Enable the setting: <i>Scan messages for unsafe URLs</i></li></ol><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0d4fcd23-446a-4366-8c14-f8e9c8cf8fea\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p>This setting is also available via <code>Set-CsTeamsMessagingConfiguration</code> PowerShell cmdlet -<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoftteams/set-csteamsmessagingconfiguration?view=teams-ps#-urlreputationcheck\" target=\"_blank\">UrlReputationCheck</a> parameter.</p><p></p><p><b>No action is required once the feature reaches General Availability</b>, as it will be turned on by default.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/malicious-url-protection-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Malicious URL Protection in Microsoft Teams</a></p> <p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><p></p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td>\n<td>URL scanning uses reputation-based detection algorithms to identify malicious links. This involves scanning user messages and performing reputation lookups against Microsoft Defender for Office's managed collection.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Does the change include an admin control that can be scoped using Entra ID group membership?</td>\n<td>Admins can enable or disable the feature via Teams Admin Center or PowerShell. However, scoping via Entra ID group membership is not supported.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody><tbody></tbody></table><p></p>\n<p><b>Reminder:\n</b></p><div>\n</div><div>General Availability begins November 3 and will take 2-3 weeks to complete. At GA, \"Scan messages for unsafe URLs\" will default to ON as previously mentioned, and link protection will apply if any participant in a conversation has it enabled. </div><div>To use a different setting, go to Teams admin center → Messaging settings → Scan messages for unsafe URLs, select your preference, and click Save before GA.</div><div><br></div><div>Note: Simply viewing the page without saving will not override the default, but settings already saved during Targeted Release will persist.</div><div>\n</div>",
