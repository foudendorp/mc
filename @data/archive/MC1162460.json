The new admin setting location provides more control to admins with management at scale using Environment Groups and Rules. The existing settings will focus more on app specific settings. <br><br>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare? </b><br>\nNo action will be required, but after the rollout is completed, admins will be encouraged to use the Copilot Settings to control access to the in-app agent features. <br><br>\nIf you would like more information on these settings, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12555/new-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot Settings</a>.",
