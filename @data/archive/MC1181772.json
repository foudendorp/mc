    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p><p>We’re improving external collaboration in Microsoft Teams by enabling file attachments and Loop sharing in 1:1, group and meeting chats with external users. This update improves the collaboration experience for Files and Loop and add a new control for IT admins. Specifically, Files and Loop components will be shared automatically with external participants in the chat and won’t require any action by the sender by default. Additionally, Entra B2B Guests in your organization will be able to attach and share files from their home tenant’s OneDrive or SharePoint.&nbsp;</p><p>This change applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Mac desktop, and web and is associated with Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=492625\" target=\"_blank\">492625</a>.</p><p>Screenshot 1: <i>Files are automatically provisioned.</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/a099fd76-7665-4ce8-b043-0f3331b55971\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: <i>Files shared have an external label and always open on Web.</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/27858dcc-8fd4-4e98-b1af-27dd3678887d\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p><ul><p></p>\n<li><b>Targeted Release:</b>&nbsp;Rollout begins late October 2025; expected to complete by mid-November 2025</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b>&nbsp;Rollout begins mid-January 2026</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p><p><b>Who is affected:</b></p><p>All Microsoft Teams users in your organization who participate in 1:1, group, or meeting chats with external users, including guest and Teams for Free users.</p><p><b>What will happen:</b></p><p>With this update: \n</p><ul><li>Unless the user chooses to share File and Loop by pasting links, external users in chat will be automatically provisioned to allow frictionless collaboration. \n</li><li>You can disable automatic provisioning and have the user change permissions manually by using policy controls.\n</li><li>If disabled, users will have to manually provision the file to users in the chat. \n</li><li>Guest users will be able to upload files from their home tenant’s OneDrive and SharePoint.\n</li><li>Files shared by external users will continue to display an <b>External&nbsp;</b>tag for clarity.\n</li><li>Loop components will now be rendered inside external chats in Teams.\n</li><li>Recipients will access File and Loop components as B2B guests within the resource tenant. If they are not already added as guests, they will need to give consent and might need to complete MFA, depending on your company’s B2B policy, before viewing the chat content.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n\n\n<ul><li>No action is required to enable the feature—it will be automatically available as the rollout progresses.</li><li>To disable the automatic provisioning behavior for files and loops set the <code>AutoShareFilesInExternalChats</code> attribute of <code>TeamsMessagingPolicy</code> to <code>Disabled</code>.
