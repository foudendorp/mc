This feature will reach general availability on October 31, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Customer service representatives can now use Copilot-powered intent suggestions to transfer conversations to the appropriate workgroup or queue. Leveraging the intent's knowledge base, Copilot effectively routes conversations to the correct line of business. If the suggested intent or user group is incorrect, representatives can override the selection and manually transfer the conversation to a workgroup or queue of their choice.<br><br><b> What action do I need to take?</b><br> This message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br> If you would like more information on this feature, please visit the  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO11218-1\">Transfer conversation to workgroup, queue using intent</a> article.",
