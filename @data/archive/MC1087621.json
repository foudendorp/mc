    "Content": "<p>Starting June 15, 2025, Microsoft will begin rolling out a new TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) relay IP range (51.5.0.0/16) in the Azure public cloud. This update supports RDP Shortpath for public networks, providing improved performance and reliability for UDP-based connections in Windows 365 Cloud PC scenarios. \n</p><p>This change will gradually shift connections from the existing ACS TURN Relay range (20.202.0.0/16) to the new Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 dedicated TURN Relay range (51.5.0.0/16). While the transition is seamless, proactive configuration is required to avoid disruptions. TCP-based connectivity is unaffected by this change.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization uses custom networking configurations such as Azure Network Connections (ANC) or hybrid networks, action is required to ensure UDP-based connectivity is maintained. \n</p><p>TCP-based RDP connectivity is unaffected by this change. \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><b>1. Ensure Accessibility \n</b></p><ul><li>Allow 51.5.0.0/16 through your firewalls and security appliances. \n</li><li>For ANC users, allow the WindowsVirtualDesktop service tag in NSGs, UDRs or firewall rules. \n</li><li>If you're using Microsoft Hosted Network Windows 365 deployments, no changes are required, but optimization is recommended. \n</li></ul><p><b>2. Optimize Connectivity \n</b></p><ul><li>Bypass TLS inspection for TURN relay traffic, it is already double encrypted, and inspection can degrade session quality. \n</li><li>Enable local egress, so traffic exits the network as close to the user as possible. \n</li><li>Bypass VPNs, proxies, and Secure Web Gateways (SWGs) to allow direct routing to Microsoft TURN services. \n</li><li>In Azure, consider configuring User Defined Routes (UDRs) to send TURN traffic directly to the internet and avoid unnecessary inspection via virtual appliances or firewalls. \n</li></ul><p><b>Key benefits: \n</b></p><ul><li>Expanded Global Coverage: From 14 to 40 Azure regions \n</li><li>Improved Connection Quality: Faster reconnections, fewer dropouts \n</li><li>Optimized Routing: Dedicated TURN range specific to Windows 365 RDP Shortpath \n</li></ul><p><b>Note</b>: The TURN relay used is based on the userâ€™s physical location, not the Cloud PC location. \n</p><p><b>Additional Resources: \n</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-365/enterprise/rdp-shortpath-public-networks\" target=\"_blank\">Use RDP Shortpath with Windows 365 Cloud PCs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview\" target=\"_blank\">WindowsVirtualDesktop service tag reference</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/shortpath-public\" target=\"_blank\">RDP Shortpath Documentation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windows365discussions/expanded-turn-relay-regions-for-windows-365-and-azure-virtual-desktop/4419716\" target=\"_blank\">Expanded TURN relay regions for Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",
