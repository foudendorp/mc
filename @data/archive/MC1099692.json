Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We're introducing a new way to seamlessly access your most recently used SharePoint agents directly within the Microsoft 365 Copilot app—no need to navigate back to the SharePoint site. This enhancement helps users stay focused and productive by reducing context switching.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=482601\" target=\"_blank\">482601</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-September 2025 (previously mid-July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>With this update, users can quickly return to their most recently used SharePoint agents from within the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. SharePoint agents are implemented as <code>.agent</code> files stored on SharePoint sites. Admins can disable an agent at any time by deleting the corresponding file.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/17e2b503-7a17-42cc-8596-7c547685a9e5\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>This feature is designed to streamline workflows and improve discoverability of agents users rely on most.
