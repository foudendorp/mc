Thank you for your patience.</p><p>If your organization does not support Android devices, you can safely ignore this message.\n</p><p>As part of our overall security hardening efforts, we will migrate Microsoft Entra ID device registration to be hardware-bound. Since the device identity will be hardware-bound, we will retire the ability for users to enable a feature called <i>Enable Browser Access </i>(EBA) in the Microsoft Authenticator app and the Microsoft Company Portal app for Android. After this retirement, browser access will automatically be enabled as part of device registration.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action or preparation is required from admins or users regarding this change. The change will occur automatically.\n</p><p>The <i>Enable Browser Access</i> feature will retire from the Company Portal and Authenticator apps for Android:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/5adf2eac-6eb7-45b5-933d-334324a1dc12\" style=\"width: 300px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>This change was first announced in <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/whats-new-in-microsoft-entra---september-2024/4253153\" target=\"_blank\">What's new in Microsoft Entra - September 2024 | Microsoft Community Hub</a> (September 2024).\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
