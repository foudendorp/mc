This feature will be generally available starting October 30, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature provides admins with enhanced control over authentication by allowing them to restrict the use of maker-provided credentials across all tools within an agent. With this control in place, only end-user credentials can be used for authentication, ensuring a more secure and user-specific connection experience.<br><br>\nBy default, this feature is turned off, giving organizations the flexibility to enable it selectively through the Power Platform admin center for specific environments or managed environment groups.<br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
