    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to govern Copilot agent development in your environments and enforce governance policies for Copilot agents. This feature will reach general avaialability on December 21, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nThis feature allows administrators to configure authentication for all agent interactions in the environment. Admins can select one of the following options:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Authenticate with Microsoft or Authenticate Manually</b> – This allows you to force authentication through Microsoft Entra ID or set up manual authentication. </li>\n<li><b>No authentication</b> allows anonymous access. </li>\n</ul>\nThe <b>Authentication for agents</b> feature is a modernized framework of the existing Data Policy virtual connector, <b>Chat without Microsoft Entra ID</b>, helping you scale through environment-level configurations and rules. <br><br>\nPlease note: If you block anonymous access in either place, at runtime the most restrictive behavior is enforced, and it will be blocked. If you're using both the virtual connector and the <b>Authentication for agents</b> setting in the <b>Security</b> area of the Power Platform admin center, <b><i> access must be allowed in both places for it to be allowed at runtime</i></b>. <br><br>\nWe recommend using the <b>Authentication for agents</b> setting in the Power Platform admin center to leverage the capability of groups and rules.<br><br>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.",
