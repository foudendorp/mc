    "Content": "<p><b>Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</b> is being extended to the network layer through integration with iboss Zero-Trust SASE Platform or Netskope One SASE Platform. This update will be generally available starting mid-November 2025. It enables organizations to intercept and inspect traffic inline and enforce actions based on Purview DLP policy conditions. This helps prevent sensitive data from being shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, apps, APIs, add-ins, and more—including generative AI platforms, cloud storage, and content-sharing services—while managing alerts and incidents through Purview and Microsoft Defender. If configured, these signals also inform user risk indicators in <i>Insider Risk Management</i>.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=522095\" target=\"_blank\">522095</a>.</p>\n\n<b>When this will happen:</b>\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout will begin in mid-November 2025 and is expected to complete by mid-December 2025.</p>\n\n<b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> Admins managing Microsoft Purview DLP policies and organizations using iboss Zero-Trust SASE or Netskope One SASE platforms.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A new scenario-focused experience will be available for creating DLP policies.</li>\n    <li>Admins can select the <b><i>Inline Web Traffic</i></b>&nbsp;scenario to configure granular rules for detecting and protecting sensitive data.</li>\n    <li>Protection will extend to over 35,000 unmanaged cloud applications.</li>\n    <li>Alerts and incidents will be managed in <i>Microsoft Purview</i> and <i>Microsoft Defender</i>.</li>\n    <li>The feature will be <b>available by default </b>but <b>requires integration setup</b> to function.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your global administrator enables and configures integration with iboss Zero-Trust SASE or Netskope One SASE platforms.</li>\n<li><b>Activate Purview pay-as-you-go</b> to enable this capability.
