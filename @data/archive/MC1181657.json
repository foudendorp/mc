By aligning data visibility with these boundaries, this update ensures that data exploration respects organizational structure and improves control over Microsoft 365 data.</p><p>This message is associated with Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=498915\" target=\"_blank\">498915</a>.</p><p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Public Preview:</b> Rollout begins early November 2025, expected to complete by mid-November 2025.</li>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):&nbsp;</b>Rollout begins early January 2026, expected to complete by mid-January 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> Admins using Microsoft Purview Content Explorer and Data Explorer; organizations using Administrative Units.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The list of items visible in Content Explorer and Data Explorer will be scoped based on the user's assigned Administrative Units.</li>\n    <li>Users without any assigned Administrative Units will see no change.</li>\n    <li>No changes to existing policies or labels are required.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review your current Administrative Unit configurations.</li>\n<li>Create and assign Administrative Units to users as needed.</li>\n<li>Communicate this change to your compliance and governance teams.</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation to reflect this new scoping capability.</li>\n<li>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/purview-admin-units\" target=\"_blank\">Administrative units in the Microsoft Purview portal | Microsoft Learn</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Alters how existing customer data is accessed</td><td>Visibility of data in Content and Data Explorer is now scoped by Admin Unit assignments.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Modifies how admins can monitor/report on compliance</td><td>Admins can now filter and scope data exploration based on Admin Units.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Includes an admin control</td><td>Admins can configure Admin Units via Microsoft Purview and Entra ID.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Can be controlled through Entra ID group membership</td><td>Admin Units are managed through Entra ID and can be assigned based on group membership.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",
