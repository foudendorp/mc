    "Content": "<b>Update: </b>Release of this feature has been postponed, we will announce a new date in the future.<br><br>\nWe are announcing the ability to govern Copilot agent development in your environments and enforce governance policies for Copilot agents. This feature will reach general availability on July 31, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nThis feature allows administrators to configure authentication for all agent interactions in the environment. Admins can select one of the following options:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Authenticate with Microsoft or Authenticate Manually</b> â€“ This allows you to force authentication through Microsoft Entra ID or set up manual authentication. </li>\n<li><b>No authentication</b> allows anonymous access. </li>\n</ul>\nThe <b>Authentication for agents</b> feature is a modernized framework of the existing Data Policy virtual connector, <b>Chat without Microsoft Entra ID</b>, helping you scale through environment-level configurations and rules. <br><br>\nPlease note: If you block anonymous access in either one of the places, then at runtime the most restrictive behavior is enforced, and it will be blocked. If you're using both the virtual connector and the <b>Authentication for agents</b> setting in the <b>Security</b> area of the Power Platform admin center, <b><i>then access must be allowed in both places for it to be allowed at runtime</i></b>. <br><br>\nWe recommend that you move towards using the <b>Authentication for agents</b> setting in the Power Platform admin center to leverage the capability of groups and rules.<br><br>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
