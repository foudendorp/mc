This feature will reach general availability on August 19, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This feature introduces a dynamic interaction model within IVR systems, enabling agents to resume from a hold state upon detecting a predefined resume word; for example, the phrase \"Got it.\" This enhancement is designed to improve the customer experience by allowing seamless transitions from passive to active states without requiring DTMF input, or full utterances. This feature will be available for all users who have the \"Optimize for Voice\" setting enabled for their agents.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
