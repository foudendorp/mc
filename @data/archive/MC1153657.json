All later releases for Windows 11 will not include WMIC added by default. Microsoft recommends using PowerShell and other modern tools for any tasks previously done with WMIC.

However, WMIC will be removed as an outdated component, streamlining Windows without losing any management capabilities in Windows. By preparing now, you can help ensure a smooth transition in Windows.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Microsoft recommends using PowerShell and other modern tools for any tasks previously done with WMIC. For example, to return a list of process names, replace the following WMIC query: wmic path win32_process get Name. Use the PowerShell command instead: Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Select-Object Name. Additionally, you can consider programmatic alternatives such as WMI’s COM API, .NET libraries, or scripting languages. Once you decide on your way forward, please update your internal IT documentation and processes.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Additional information:</b>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Get more context and mitigation guidance at <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/windows-management-instrumentation-command-line-wmic-removal-from-windows-e9e83c7f-4992-477f-ba1d-96f694b8665d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) removal from Windows</a>.</li><li>Learn about <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WMI command-line (WMIC) utility</a>.</li><li>Transition to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/07-working-with-wmi?view=powershell-7.5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WMI in PowerShell</a>.</li></ul>",
