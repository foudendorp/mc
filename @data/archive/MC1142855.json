    "Content": "We are announcing Service Principle Name (SPN) filtering for application users in Power Platform. This enhancement allows administrators to configure IP firewall settings to bypass or restrict access for specific third-party application users. Previously, IP firewall settings applied to all application users but now, admins can target access more precisely.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>By default, this feature is disabled. Admins can enable SPN filtering using API configurations. This update does not impact end users directly but provides granular control for administrators managing third-party application access.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>Admins should review the updated IP firewall documentation and plan for API-based configuration if they wish to enable SPN filtering. No UI controls are available at this time.<br><br>For more information about this feature, please refer to the following documentation: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12007\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/ip-firewall</a>.",
