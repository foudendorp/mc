With this rollout, Copilot will first use images from your organization library before using Microsoft 365 images as backup. Users have the option to use only on-brand images by turning on the image settings. However, if you do not wish for Copilot to use any Microsoft 365 images when creating a presentation, send an email to <a href=\"mailto://pptentimg_admin@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">pptentimg_admin@microsoft.com</a>. <b>NOTE:</b> Disabling all Microsoft 365 images will severely impact the Copilot output for creating presentations. We recommend considering this option only if you have more than 1,000 images with robust metadata in your image library.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/keep-your-presentation-on-brand-with-copilot-046c23d5-012e-49e0-8579-fe49302959fc\" target=\"_blank\">Keep your presentation on-brand with Copilot - Microsoft Support</a>\n<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/connect-organizational-asset-libraries-to-copilot\" target=\"_blank\"></a> (will be updated before rollout begins)\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/connect-organizational-asset-libraries-to-copilot\" target=\"_blank\">Connect organizational asset libraries to Copilot for an on-brand experience - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/organization-assets-library\" target=\"_blank\">Create an organization assets library - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",
