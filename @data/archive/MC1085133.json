    "Content": "<p>Updated June 25, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>This feature will empower administrators to manage the availability of trusted Microsoft Teams apps based on rules, for enhanced security. Admins will be able to manage Microsoft 365 certified apps in the Teams admin center through a new control in <i>Org-wide settings</i>. You can further customize the availability of these apps based on permissions accessed and publisher names. The system automatically checks the Microsoft 365 certified apps that meet all the conditions you specify and makes those apps available. <b>Note: </b>This feature will be ON by default.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=485712\" target=\"_blank\">485712</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2025 (earlier mid-July 2025) and expect to complete by mid-October (earlier August 2025)</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Before this rollout, you cannot manage at bulk the availability of Microsoft 365 certified apps. They are only controlled by third-party app tenant settings.\n</p><p>After this rollout, you can manage Microsoft 365 certified apps availability from org-wide settings in the Teams admin center at <i>Manage apps &gt; Actions &gt; Org-wide app settings &gt; Microsoft 365 certified apps</i>. The <i>All apps available</i> option will be on by default after this rollout.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e2c6ba81-7623-471a-8d06-0b6ad6e2ef00\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>You can configure additional criteria from the <i>Customize availability </i>option:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/c2d0f382-0897-432d-8a46-028de82b2e2d\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>No action is required for the tenants who have turned on <i>Org-wide app settings </i>for third-party apps.</p><p>For tenants who have turned off <i>Org-wide app settings</i> for third-party apps, we recommend you review the NEW tenant settings described in this message. We will update this post with the final GA timeline closer to launch time. After the feature releases in your tenant, you will have 30 days to make changes to these settings before they start affecting the availability of Microsoft 365 certified apps. The 30-day delayed impact to availability of these apps is a one-time occurrence for this launch. After this 30-day period, the settings will have immediate impact, honoring the NEW tenant settings to manage the availability of these apps.</p><p>Learn more: <i>Manage org-wide app settings</i> in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-apps#manage-org-wide-app-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Manage your apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> (will be updated before rollout)</p>",
