    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to use the new connector management rule in Microsoft Power Platform governance and administration. This feature will reach general availability on November 30, 2025.<br><br>  \n\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \n\nWith the new connector management rule, admins can choose to block any connector. New connectors are blocked by default, which gives more control back to the admins. The scope of environments impacted will be easier to manage using environment groups, compared to the many-to-many model of data policies available today.<br><br> \n\nAdmins can visit an environment group and see the new <b>Advanced data policies: connector management rule</b> available to configure. This rule allows admins to create an allow-list of exactly the connectors they want to use, and all other connectors will be blocked from use in apps, flows, and agents.<br><br> \n\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br> \n\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br> \n\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO11234\"target=\"_blank\">Use the new connector management rule</a> article.",
