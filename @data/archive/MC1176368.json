    "Content": "<p><b><b>Introduction</b></b></p>\n<p>We’re updating the default experience for users with the Microsoft 365 Copilot license by introducing GPT-5 as the standard model. GPT-5 is OpenAI’s most advanced language model, designed to deliver faster, more accurate, and more context-aware responses. It features dynamic model routing, which automatically selects the best-performing variant for each prompt—using high-throughput models for quick replies and deeper reasoning models for complex tasks. This change simplifies the user experience and enhances performance across all Copilot endpoints.</p>\n\n<p><b><b>When this will happen:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>General Availability (Worldwide):</b>&nbsp;Phased rollout begins late October 2025 and completes by late November 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>How this affects your organization:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> All users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license across web, desktop, and mobile experiences.</li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b><p></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The rollout will occur in <b>two phases</b>:</li>\n    <ul>\n      <li><b>Phase 1 (web, desktop)</b><b>:</b> <i>GPT-5 toggle</i> is enabled by default. Users can choose to disable GPT-5 via the toggle and revert to previous models.</li>\n      <li><b>Phase 2 (web, desktop, mobile):</b> GPT-5 becomes the default model. Users will no longer be able to opt out, and the <i>GPT-5 toggle</i> button will be removed.</li></ul>\n    <li>The GPT-5 default experience will also apply to <i>Copilot Chat</i> in the Microsoft 365 apps. The exception is on Teams mobile, which is planned to rollout beginning late November 2025.</li><li>Copilot will automatically trigger GPT-5 reasoning based on prompt complexity.<ul><li>Users will be able to bypass GPT-5 reasoning and get a direct response by selecting \"Get a quick answer.\"<p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/46eb06dd-0973-4e58-b4dc-95483c17599e/a87006639c5ab156b7bab142c123df82315dfbcc.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul>\n  </ul>\n<p></p><ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No admin action is required to enable this feature.</li>\n<li>Communicate the phased rollout to helpdesk and support teams.</li>\n<li>Update internal documentation to reflect the default use of GPT-5 and how to bypass reasoning if desired.</li>\n<li>Review any training materials or user guides that reference the <i>GPT-5 toggle</i>.</li></ul><p></p>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations</b></b></p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Introduces or modifies AI/ML capabilities</td><td>GPT-5 introduces enhanced model routing and deeper reasoning capabilities that interact with user data.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Provides new ways of interacting with generative AI</td><td>Users will now interact with GPT-5 by default, without manual model selection.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Includes admin control</td><td>Admins can monitor usage via existing Copilot reporting tools but cannot disable GPT-5 as default after Phase 2.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Allows a user to enable and disable the feature themselves</td><td>Users can use the toggle to opt out of GPT-5 during Phase 1; Users cannot opt out during Phase 2, but they can bypass GPT-5 reasoning to get a direct response.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",

      "Value": "GPT-5 will become the default Microsoft 365 Copilot model in a phased rollout from October to November 2025. Initially, users can toggle GPT-5 on or off; later, it becomes mandatory with no opt-out. GPT-5 offers faster, more accurate responses with dynamic model routing and reasoning features."
