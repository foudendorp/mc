    "Content": "We are announcing an enhancement to reduce the system downtime while processing customer-managed keys which will start to roll out on June 23, 2025 and reach global availability on July 7, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Previously, when you applied customer-managed keys or reverted a customer-managed key to a Microsoft managed key, the environments were deactivated until all the Dataverse storage services complete the data encryption.  This system downtime could take up to 4 days for all data encryption to complete.<br><br>We have now streamlined the Dataverse data encryption process to re-enable the environment’s online status as soon as the core storage services that required system downtime are complete. The environment is released with a customer-managed key encryption status of “Encrypting – online” while the storage services that don’t require system downtime continue to run.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br>For more information, please review the documentation available here: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/11156\" target=\"_blank\">Manage your customer-managed encryption key - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn.</a>",
