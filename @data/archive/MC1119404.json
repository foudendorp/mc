    "Content": "<p>Updated July 28, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We're introducing a new self-service capability in the Teams Admin Center (TAC) that allows Teams Phone administrators to resolve and resubmit certain porting order rejections without needing to contact Microsoft support. This enhancement improves efficiency and reduces turnaround time for common porting issues, while preserving the existing support experience for more complex cases.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p><b>General Availability:</b> We will begin rolling out in<b>&nbsp;early August 2025 (previously late July) </b>and expect to complete by <b>early August 2025</b>.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>This update streamlines the current porting experience in TAC without removing any existing features. Administrators will now be able to use the existing porting wizard not only to submit new porting orders but also to fix and resubmit certain rejected orders.\n</p><p>When a porting order is rejected for a fixable reason—such as an incorrect ZIP code or missing PIN—administrators will:\n</p><ul><li>Receive an email notification.\n</li><li>See a prompt on the order's detail page in TAC.\n</li><li>Be guided through the porting wizard to correct and resubmit the order.\n</li></ul><p>This self-serve experience is designed to feel familiar and intuitive, minimizing disruption. Rejections that require partner coordination or are otherwise ineligible for self-service will continue to be handled by Microsoft support.\n</p><p>This feature is:\n</p><ul><li>On by default\n</li><li>Available to all tenants\n</li><li>Accessible to Teams Phone administrators with appropriate permissions\n</li></ul><p>Admins can still contact Microsoft support if needed.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Steps to resolve a rejected porting order in Teams Admin Center</b></p><p>To fix and resubmit a rejected porting order:</p><p style=\"\">a.
