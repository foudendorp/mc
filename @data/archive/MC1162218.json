    "Content": "<b>Update:</b> Release of this feature has been postponed; we will announce a new date in the future.<br><br>\nWe are announcing the ability to automate approvals decisions with Intelligent Approvals in Microsoft Copilot Studio. This feature will reach general availability on October 28, 2025. <br> <br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b> <br>\nWith this feature, makers will not need to route every approval to a human. Instead, they configure an AI stage where a large language model evaluates the request using natural language prompts and contextual variables, such as text, documents, and images. The AI uses the defined logic to decide whether to approve or reject the request. Makers keep full control and decide if approvals are automatic or if humans can veto them. <br> <br>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required. <br> <br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12065/automate-approvals-decisions-intelligent-approvals\" target=\"_blank\">Automate approvals decisions with Intelligent Approvals</a>.",
