If multiple meetings are active, the banner will display the count and offer a “View More” call-to-action, enabling users to choose which meeting to join. This enhancement supports quicker access to meetings and improves user productivity.</p><p><b>Rollout Schedule</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Public Preview:</b> Mid July 2025 – Late July 2025</li>\n<li><b>Targeted Release:</b> Mid July 2025 – Late July 2025</li>\n<li><b>General Availability:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Worldwide: Mid-July 2025 – Late July 2025</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Impact on Your Organization</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Who is affected:</b> <ul><li>All users who RSVP “Yes” or “Tentative” to meetings in Microsoft Teams.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>What will happen:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A banner will appear when a meeting the user has RSVP’d to is live.</li>\n    <li>Users can join the meeting directly from the banner.</li>\n    <li>If multiple meetings are live, the banner will show the number of active meetings and a “View More” option.<p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/4840d809-23c2-40cc-ac41-d3f8a705acb3\" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p></li>\n    <li>This feature is ON by default.</li>\n    <li>Users can disable the banner via Teams notification settings.</li>\n    <li>No admin configuration is required.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Action Required/Recommendations</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No action is required to enable this feature.
