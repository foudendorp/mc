    "Content": "We are enhancing the Data masking service to allow administrators to view masked fields via the client and enable auditors to see who accessed and read sensitive fields with unmasked values. These updates will be rolled out globally from August 8, 2025, through September 5, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nPreviously, reading unmasked values from the client was not available. We have now enabled this capability, allowing system administrators to unmask sensitive columns by selecting a button next to the column on the client form.<br><br>\nAll read requests to sensitive masked columns are logged in the audit trails, and this audit event can be found in the Auditing tab on the Power Platform Environment settings app.<br><br>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>\nTo read unmasked values, you will need to create a Column level security profile with permission to the Read unmasked option and add authorized users to the security profile.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this update, please refer to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO11654\"target=\"_blank\">Create and manage masking rules (preview) - Power Platform</a>.",
