    "Content": "<p>Updated August 6, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac is introducing a new Copilot capability that helps users expand their presentations by generating new topic ideas and corresponding slides. These slides will match the look and feel of the existing presentation, ensuring a seamless experience.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=496138\" target=\"_blank\">496138</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability: Rollout will begin in mid-August 2025 (previously late July) for PowerPoint on Mac desktop.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With this update, users can prompt Copilot to generate and insert new content into their existing presentations. Copilot will create slides that are visually consistent with the current deck. Users can initiate this by entering a prompt or referencing a file. This feature enhances productivity by streamlining content creation and maintaining design consistency.\n</p><p>A Microsoft 365 license is required to access this Copilot feature.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required prior to rollout. You may wish to inform your users about this new capability and update any relevant training or documentation to reflect the change.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Alters how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed: Maybe - If users reference existing files or content, Copilot may process that data to generate new slides. However, it does not change how the data is stored or accessed within Microsoft 365.</li><li>Introduces or modifies AI/ML capabilities that interact with customer data: Yes - This update introduces a generative AI capability (Copilot) that processes user input and referenced content to generate new slides, directly interacting with customer data.</li><li>Provides end users a new way of interacting with generative AI: Yes - Users can now interact with Copilot to generate new presentation content, representing a new method of engaging with generative AI in PowerPoint.</li></ul>",
