Live captions are now scrollable, allowing users to review past conversation with more flexibility and over a larger surface area. Next, copying captions is disabled by default to protect sensitive information and support compliance. Additionally, the live transcript panel won’t open automatically with features that trigger transcription—like recording, giving users greater control over their layout. Lastly, If transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the live transcript panel will see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions for real-time comprehension.

File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media. 4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.

Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths.\n3. File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media.\n4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

    "Description": "This new capability ties together SharePoint Online library permissions with Purview sensitivity labeling and protection. SharePoint Online document library owners can set a label on the library, automatically applying that label to all unprotected and unlabeled Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files at rest in the target library. This simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization. This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the online copy of the document. Changes to user permissions on the online copy of the document are reflected on downloaded copy, including full access removal. This provides a more streamlined way to revoke access to documents for individual users, versus revoking access on a per-document basis.<br>GA date: July CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2024"

    "Description": "Viva Glint's Company Admin role currently prevents editing of any role permissions, including feature controls for survey program reporting. While this restriction helps prevent accidental disruption of critical admin capabilities, it has emerged as a significant barrier to Copilot adoption. Customers must create and maintain redundant custom roles solely to enable Copilot access for Company Admin users, adding unnecessary complexity to deployment and ongoing management. This feature update will allow Company Admins to enable Copilot for themselves at the Viva Glint client user role level via a new toggle in General Settings. This enables Copilot across all eligible recurring and ad-hoc survey programs without altering the permissions architecture of the Company Admin role at the program level. All existing Company Admin user role permissions remain locked to preserve critical admin safeguards. This targeted change preserves essential admin role safeguards while removing a key friction point in Copilot deployment. <br>GA date: July CY2025"

This new capability allows users to quickly access a comprehensive summary of eDiscovery cases, holds, and searches, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple tabs to assess status, statistics of completed actions, pending tasks, and ongoing jobs.\n\nThe \"Quick Summarization\" feature consolidates this information into a single, easy-to-understand summary. Additionally, similar summary views are available for both Search and Hold within the eDiscovery case. Powered by existing “contextual summary” skill, the system analyzes case/search/hold metadata and generates natural language summaries, providing users with a clear, actionable overview of key details in real-time.<br>GA date: March CY2025"

    "Description": "The Purview eDiscovery team has increased the limits for Hold policies for eDiscovery Premium in the new purview.microsoft.com portal. \n\nThe maximum number of mailboxes in a single case hold has been increased from 1,000 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.<br>GA date: March CY2025"

    "Description": "With this feature, IRM analysts can identify if the user being investigated has any compromised user alerts in Microsoft Entra. This will help them formulate the right response action, like escalating the Incident to SOC teams for quick remediation, etc. \n\nMicrosoft Entra offers two types of compromised user detections.\n1. Sign in risk detections: compromise risk associated with a specific sign-in.\n2. User risk detections: compromise risk associated with a specific user.\n\nInsider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.  <br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks<br>GA date: May CY2025<br>Preview date: December CY2024"

    "Description": "We are excited to announce the addition of two post creation options—Article and Question—to the centralized creation button in Viva Engage for premium users. Starting April 2025, a Viva Engage premium licensed user will be able to create an article or a question post type directly by clicking on the \"Create new\" button, easing the process of creation of these post types, while also helping users discover them quicker. Kindly note that this roll out does not entail adding new types of content creation, but brings forth a unified and easier way to create these post types when a user is already licensed to use them.\nBy 'Viva Engage premium licensed user', we mean this feature is available for users licensed to the Microsoft Viva Suite or the Microsoft Viva Employee Communications and Communities Suite. <br>GA date: April CY2025"

Sample reports include alerts generated over time, alerts actioned over time, alerts and cases generated by region and department, top triggering events of alerts generated, and average time to triage alerts and cases. The ability to filter reports will also be introduced. Users with the admin, analyst or investigator role will have access to view the new Alerts & cases report. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: May CY2025<br>Preview date: December CY2024"

This count considers users accessing sites via site membership and users accessing via unique permissions, as well and acts like a potential threshold for oversharing. Along with the permissioned user count, the report also provides information on the number of existing sharing links (Anyone and People-in-your-org) in those sites and enables SharePoint admins to identify potential root causes for oversharing.

    "Description": "On the alert list page, high priority alerts will be spotlighted to help analysts prioritize the most important alerts first. Alerts are spotlighted based on predefined rules which are common across all tenants across all industries. Alert Spotlighting feature was developed to assist admins in prioritizing alerts to be triaged.  Every generated alert has a risk score, a list of activities performed, tags, and triggers. The Alert Spotlighting feature uses this information to decide whether an alert can be spotlighted. Based on a detailed study of alert triage patterns across tenants, we have developed a rule-based algorithm to spotlight alerts that would be of importance to admins, based on historical volume analysis. \nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: December CY2024<br>Preview date: October CY2024"

If the meeting organizer deletes the transcript from Stream, only the copy in OneDrive for Business will be deleted. We also update the default permissions so that meeting organizer and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition, the recording/transcript file owner will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript. At the same time, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive for Business.

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file<br>GA date: March CY2025"

First, when transcription, recording, or Copilot are enabled before or during the meeting, users will be prompted to select the spoken language to ensure transcription accuracy. Second, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizers, and transcript initiator will be able to change the spoken language. Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.<br>GA date: February CY2025"

    "Description": "This feature introduces SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented) user setting in the Walkie Talkie app. This feature is designed to manage the Bluetooth headset connection to optimize battery life. When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.<br>GA date: March CY2025"

SharePoint Online document library owners can set a label on the library, automatically applying that label to all unprotected and unlabeled Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files in the target library. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library. This provides a more centralized information worker-managed permission model that also offers revocation capabilities at a user level, rather than per-document. <br>GA date: July CY2025"

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.<br>GA date: February CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2024"

    "Description": "OneDrive for web now lets you find your files faster than ever with a new and improved search functionality. Say goodbye to the days of endlessly scrolling through folders to find that one elusive document. With our latest update, locating your files is now faster and more intuitive than ever before. Whether it's in your personal OneDrive, shared folders, or document libraries, our improved search feature allows you to seamlessly sift through your digital workspace from one centralized location. We've added new filters for different file types, ensuring you can pinpoint exactly what you're looking for and with the date filter, you can narrow down your search results to find files created or modified within a specific timeframe. We understand that searching within a folder or document library is important to you, and for that, we have simplified scoping options that will enable precise searches within folders, sites, or document libraries. We've also visually updated the interface with more metadata, ensuring you effortlessly identify the right files every time.<br>GA date: September CY2024"

    "Description": "Granular exclusion allows admins to adjust and fine tune indicators according to organizational preferences to help tailor the detection of risks that may lead to a potential security incident. For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g. outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: October CY2024"

First, our updated policy conditions enable the detection of messages sent and received both to and from external email addresses, allowing you to identify specific instances of information being shared with external contacts. Secondly, with the new OR condition capability, you can combine multiple conditions within the same policy, creating custom logic to suit your unique compliance requirements. Lastly, to make policy creation and updates a seamless process, we've introduced the ability to test conditions before implementing them. By using sample messages, you can evaluate how your conditions will perform and fine-tune them to align with your compliance goals.<br>GA date: June CY2025"
