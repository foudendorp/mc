The new DSPM experience unifies visibility and control across traditional data and AI-driven environments, delivering outcome-based guided workflows that turn insights into actionable steps—so teams can prioritize risks and remediate faster. It brings AI observability, enhanced posture reporting, and intelligent Security Copilot agents to automate tasks like triage and policy management. Plus, Purview now extends coverage beyond Microsoft data with third-party signals from partners like BigID, Cyera, OneTrust, and Varonis, giving security teams a single, streamlined view of sensitive data across clouds and platforms. Together, these innovations make DSPM the central hub for managing data security posture in the era of AI. We are also extending Data Risk Assessments to Fabric and to item-level analysis with new remediation actions like bulk disabling of overshared SharePoint links.<br>GA date: April CY2026<br>Preview date: December CY2025",

Faster Access: Access event details (e.g. Impacted assets) with just 1 click on the main alerts page itself, compared to 4 clicks earlier, reducing triage time significantly. 3. Enhanced Context: We've added 4 new columns - Location, DLP Rule name, DLP Policy name, Rule Action to display key alert and event attributes upfront — giving you more visibility at a glance. 4. Performance Boost: Cache improvements to ensure faster load times and a smoother experience.

This feature allows global administrators to use prepaid message subscriptions before incurring pay-as-you-go (PAYG) charges. Each Capacity Pack provides 25,000 Copilot messages per month, which can be allocated to Copilot Chat environments via the Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC). Once enabled, MAC will prioritize consumption from these prepaid packs and automatically switch to PAYG when the pack is exhausted. Admins can monitor usage in PPAC, including: • Total messages consumed • Remaining prepaid capacity • Message allocation per environment Key Benefits: • Streamlined billing setup in MAC • Reduced risk of overage charges • Automated environment provisioning for Copilot Chat • Improved cost visibility and governance<br>GA date: October CY2025",

First, our updated policy conditions enable the detection of messages sent and received both to and from external email addresses, allowing you to identify specific instances of information being shared with external contacts. Secondly, with the new OR condition capability, you can combine multiple conditions within the same policy, creating custom logic to suit your unique compliance requirements. Lastly, to make policy creation and updates a seamless process, we've introduced the ability to test conditions before implementing them. By using sample messages, you can evaluate how your conditions will perform and fine-tune them to align with your compliance goals.<br>GA date: November CY2025",

    "Description": "Sections with Copilot is a new SharePoint authoring tool that allows users to create full-fidelity SharePoint sections with just a prompt. It works by first looking at the context of your page to offer prompt suggestions for what content you need next to offer a starting point. Next, you either select one of those starting points or write your own and optionally ground in a relevant file.\n \nOnce you click generate, Sections with Copilot then leverages the knowledge and content already inside of your organization and on your page to create rich sections that go beyond just image and text. This could mean meeting transcripts, recent documents, or any other knowledge Copilot has access to, added to an existing page with a click of a button. \n \nIf the output section isn't quite right, you can then use AI refinement to make changes to both the content and layout of your section, without ever touching our traditional authoring tools. Some examples include \"change the background image\", \"add John Smith's contact information\", or \"make the text more professional\". You can also get different suggestions by clicking \"regenerate\" and then choosing your favorite one to refine further. With Sections with Copilot, you can create content faster than ever before, no matter your SharePoint skill level. <br>GA date: September CY2025",

While this restriction helps prevent accidental disruption of critical admin capabilities, it has emerged as a significant barrier to Copilot adoption. Customers must create and maintain redundant custom roles solely to enable Copilot access for Company Admin users, adding unnecessary complexity to deployment and ongoing management. This feature update will allow Company Admins to enable Copilot for themselves at the Viva Glint client user role level via a new toggle in General Settings. This enables Copilot across all eligible recurring and ad-hoc survey programs without altering the permissions architecture of the Company Admin role at the program level. All existing Company Admin user role permissions remain locked to preserve critical admin safeguards.

With our latest release, Copilot is now smarter and more helpful than ever, leveraging your files, like Word documents, and even meeting content, to generate high-quality communications with ease. Here’s what’s new: 1. Smarter prompt tuning We’ve fine-tuned how drafts and rewrites are handled, resulting in clearer, better-formatted output that aligns with your tone and goals. 2. Create content from files and meetings You can now use Word and Excel files, or even meeting recordings, as inputs to help generate content. Whether you're working from a doc, a spreadsheet, or a conversation, Copilot in Amplify helps you turn ideas into polished messaging. 3. Unified content generation flow We’ve migrated to a common service that brings a consistent and scalable experience across all your AI tools in SharePoint and Viva Amplify. What's more, generated content now appears in real-time, making the experience smoother and faster. These updates are part of our continued investment in delivering an intelligent, seamless authoring experience.<br>GA date: August CY2025",

Sending email with attachments to free public domains - This alerts when business-sensitive data is potentially leaked from a work email account to a free public domain email, potentially leading to a data security incident. 2. Sending email with attachments to self - This alerts when business-sensitive data is potentially leaked from a work email account to user's personal email account or emailing self, potentially leading to a data security incident. Admins with appropriate permissions can enable these indicators from the settings page and use these new indicators in the data leaks or data theft policy template. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: July CY2025",

Live captions are now scrollable, allowing users to review past conversation with more flexibility and over a larger surface area. Next, copying captions is disabled by default to protect sensitive information and support compliance. Additionally, the live transcript panel won’t open automatically with features that trigger transcription—like recording, giving users greater control over their layout. Lastly, If transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the live transcript panel will see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions for real-time comprehension.

Keyword logic update for email - An email will be excluded from scoring only when all the attachments match the keyword exclusions or email subject matches the keyword exclusions. This will be helpful to reduce the email signature noise which commonly contains keyword \"image\". 2. Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths. 3. File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media. 4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.

Keyword logic update for email - An email will be excluded from scoring only when all the attachments match the keyword exclusions or email subject matches the keyword exclusions. This will be helpful to reduce the email signature noise which commonly contains keyword \"image\".\n2. Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths.\n3. File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media.\n4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

This new capability allows users to quickly access a comprehensive summary of eDiscovery cases, holds, and searches, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple tabs to assess status, statistics of completed actions, pending tasks, and ongoing jobs.\n\nThe \"Quick Summarization\" feature consolidates this information into a single, easy-to-understand summary. Additionally, similar summary views are available for both Search and Hold within the eDiscovery case. Powered by existing “contextual summary” skill, the system analyzes case/search/hold metadata and generates natural language summaries, providing users with a clear, actionable overview of key details in real-time.<br>GA date: March CY2025",

    "Description": "The Purview eDiscovery team has increased the limits for Hold policies for eDiscovery Premium in the new purview.microsoft.com portal. \n\nThe maximum number of mailboxes in a single case hold has been increased from 1,000 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.<br>GA date: March CY2025",

The rollout of this feature also improves the delete experience of the transcript for meeting organizers. Now, when a meeting organizer or co-organizer deletes the transcript in Microsoft Teams app, this will delete both copies of the transcript (from OneDrive for Business and Exchange Online) at the same time. If the meeting organizer deletes the transcript from Stream, only the copy in OneDrive for Business will be deleted. We also update the default permissions so that meeting organizer and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition, the recording/transcript file owner will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript. At the same time, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive for Business.

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file<br>GA date: March CY2025",

Next, we’re simplifying the settings by creating a new settings page for meeting spoken language and translation language for live translated captions at Caption settings > Language settings > Meeting spoken language and transcript found at Transcript > Language settings > Meeting spoken language.  Lastly, when participants speak a language that doesn’t match the selected language in the spoken language setting, the meeting organizer, co-organizer and initiator will get a notification that the language is mismatched.<br>GA date: February CY2025",

When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.<br>GA date: March CY2025",

Key changes with export enhancements: The biggest change being introduced is that with the new user experience for eDiscovery where Standard and Premium cases have unified structure, the export is also aligned for both the streams – thereby providing a singular experience to customers. The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.<br>GA date: February CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2024",
