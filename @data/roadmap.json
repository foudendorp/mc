Faster Access: Access event details (e.g. Impacted assets) with just 1 click on the main alerts page itself, compared to 4 clicks earlier, reducing triage time significantly. 3. Enhanced Context: We've added 4 new columns - Location, DLP Rule name, DLP Policy name, Rule Action to display key alert and event attributes upfront — giving you more visibility at a glance. 4. Performance Boost: Cache improvements to ensure faster load times and a smoother experience.

    "Description": "To help organizations manage metered consumption costs for SharePoint Agents and Copilot Tuning, we are introducing support for Capacity Packs in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC). This feature allows global administrators to use prepaid message subscriptions before incurring pay-as-you-go (PAYG) charges. Each Capacity Pack provides 25,000 Copilot messages per month, which can be allocated to Copilot Chat environments via the Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC). Once enabled, MAC will prioritize consumption from these prepaid packs and automatically switch to PAYG when the pack is exhausted. Admins can monitor usage in PPAC, including: • Total messages consumed • Remaining prepaid capacity • Message allocation per environment Key Benefits: • Streamlined billing setup in MAC • Reduced risk of overage charges • Automated environment provisioning for Copilot Chat • Improved cost visibility and governance<br>GA date: October CY2025",

IRM alerts will be surfaced in unified alert and Incident queue in Microsoft Defender XDR. 2. IRM alerts, Indicators, and enriched events will be available in Microsoft Defender XDR advanced hunting. Analysts can leverage KQL queries to identify potentially hidden risky patterns in data security related user activity. 3. IRM alert, Indicators, and enriched events will be exposed through Graph API. This feature can be enabled through “Share data with Microsoft Defender XDR” within Microsoft Insider Risk Management settings. To ensure privacy of the data, all IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR can only be accessed by users with Insider risk analyst or Insider risk investigator permissions in Purview. Existing analysts accessing IRM data in purview will continue to access IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR. IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR does not honor anonymization. This is to enable effective correlation of IRM alerts with alerts from other solutions in Microsoft Defender XDR platform (such as Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud apps, etc.). Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: August CY2025<br>Preview date: January CY2025",

It works by first looking at the context of your page to offer prompt suggestions for what content you need next to offer a starting point. Next, you either select one of those starting points or write your own and optionally ground in a relevant file.\n \nOnce you click generate, Sections with Copilot then leverages the knowledge and content already inside of your organization and on your page to create rich sections that go beyond just image and text. This could mean meeting transcripts, recent documents, or any other knowledge Copilot has access to, added to an existing page with a click of a button. \n \nIf the output section isn't quite right, you can then use AI refinement to make changes to both the content and layout of your section, without ever touching our traditional authoring tools. Some examples include \"change the background image\", \"add John Smith's contact information\", or \"make the text more professional\". You can also get different suggestions by clicking \"regenerate\" and then choosing your favorite one to refine further. With Sections with Copilot, you can create content faster than ever before, no matter your SharePoint skill level. <br>GA date: September CY2025",

This feature update will allow Company Admins to enable Copilot for themselves at the Viva Glint client user role level via a new toggle in General Settings. This enables Copilot across all eligible recurring and ad-hoc survey programs without altering the permissions architecture of the Company Admin role at the program level.

This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration.

This new capability allows users to quickly access a comprehensive summary of eDiscovery cases, holds, and searches, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple tabs to assess status, statistics of completed actions, pending tasks, and ongoing jobs.\n\nThe \"Quick Summarization\" feature consolidates this information into a single, easy-to-understand summary. Additionally, similar summary views are available for both Search and Hold within the eDiscovery case. Powered by existing “contextual summary” skill, the system analyzes case/search/hold metadata and generates natural language summaries, providing users with a clear, actionable overview of key details in real-time.<br>GA date: March CY2025",

This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.<br>GA date: March CY2025",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file<br>GA date: March CY2025",

When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.<br>GA date: March CY2025",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.<br>GA date: February CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2024",
