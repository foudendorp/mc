  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Cross Cloud collaboration in VDI",
  "Description": "VDI users can join meetings with people in other Microsoft 365 cloud environments (e.g., a user in GCCH joining a meeting in commercial, GCC or DOD) through three options: authenticated access via cross-cloud meeting connection, authenticated access using a guest account, or anonymous access. These scenarios require Slimcore-based optimization, as WebRTC-based optimization does not support meetings across different cloud environments.<br>GA date: April CY2025",
