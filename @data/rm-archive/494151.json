  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Default Teams Calling global policy to enable users to transcribe or record calls",
  "Description": "Weâ€™re updating the default global calling policy for new tenants to allow users to transcribe or record calls. Previously, these settings were turned off by default in the host global policy. With this update, recording and transcription will be enabled by default in the global calling policy for new tenants and existing tenants who have not modified the host global policy. This change will not impact existing custom policies or modified global policies. After this rollout, recording and transcription services will be more accessible to users, allowing them to turn on and use recording and transcription as needed during Teams calls. Neither recording nor transcription will be automatically enabled in Teams calls. This update is designed to broaden access to AI-powered features like Calls Recap and Calling Copilot, enhancing the overall calling experience. It also brings calling policy defaults in line with Teams meetings policies, where recording and transcription are already enabled by default.<br>GA date: July CY2025"
