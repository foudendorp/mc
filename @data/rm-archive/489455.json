  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Block a user for your organization in GCC-High and DoD",
  "Id": "489455",
  "Description": "We have decided not to release this feature at this time and will add a new item to the roadmap in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. With the availability of the delete API (removeallaccessforuser API), it does not stop the malicious user from resending the message to the same victim. To help prevent that, a block user API will allow the admin to block the malicious user from reaching out again. To make this even more effective, we will utilize a similar feature as the allow/block list in federation to block the malicious user from the entire organization.<br>GA date: July CY2025",
