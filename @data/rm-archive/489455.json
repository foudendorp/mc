  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Block a user for your organization in GCC-High and DoD",
  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "489455",
  "Description": "With the availability of the delete API (removeallaccessforuser API), it does not stop the malicious user from resending the message to the same victim. To help prevent that, a block user API will allow the admin to block the malicious user from reaching out again. To make this even more effective, we will utilize a similar feature as the allow/block list in federation to block the malicious user from the entire organization.<br>GA date: July CY2025"
