  "Description": "We’re introducing a new capability in Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management to bypass retention policies and delete content from OneDrive and SharePoint Online before the hold or retention policy duration expires. This feature helps organizations manage Copilot-related artifacts—such as Teams recordings and transcripts—independently of OneDrive retention polices, so organizations can decide how long they want to keep and when to delete this content.\nThe feature includes support for simulation testing, audit, and disposition reviews, and introduces admin policy authoring flows. These flows are governed by Microsoft Purview role groups to enable the creation and enforcement of defensible deletion policies.<br>GA date: August CY2025<br>Preview date: July CY2025",
