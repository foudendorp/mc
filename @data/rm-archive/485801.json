  "Description": "We're introducing a new 'View and Upload' permission for folder 'Anyone' links in the OneDrive Admin Sharing Settings. This feature allows tenants to restrict folder links to 'Anyone can view' while still enabling the 'Request Files' functionality. It offers tenants more granular control over content access, ensures compliance with internal policies, and helps administrators maintain a higher level of data governance.<br>GA date: June CY2025"
