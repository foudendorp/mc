  "Description": "The Facilitator agent works alongside you and your team to help you manage your meetings effortlessly. Throughout the meeting, Facilitator takes notes that everyone can co-author, manages the time and agenda, and can quickly surface relevant information from the web or the conversation itself. Users can now use the Facilitator agent in Teams Rooms on Windows for real-time notes and action items during both scheduled hybrid and impromptu in-person meetings using AI. In hybrid meetings, the agent appears in the notes panel. For in-person meetings, a participant can scan the QR code on the display in the room to invoke the agent as the group's assistant.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
