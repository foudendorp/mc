  "Description": "With a Teams Room on Windows system, both attendees and presenters for Teams Town halls and Webinars can now simultaneously enjoy unique experiences in the same room. This new feature sets the in-room viewing experience on the front of room display to attendee view by default so presenter-specific features, such as the green room and backroom chat, or off-stage presenters are hidden. Presenters in the room can still see their view on the console and manage everything smoothly without distracting the audience. Available in Teams Rooms Pro.<br>GA date: August CY2025",
