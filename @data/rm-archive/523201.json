  "Description": "Microsoft Purview introduces the Classifier Simulation Mode, the first phase of the broader Classifier Health Monitoring Platform. \n \nThis capability enables you to test, analyze, and optimize custom classifiers on production data before publishing them, hence offering a reliable means of verifying the effectiveness of classifiers before committing them to live environments.  \n\nCustom classifiers are powerful tools but can sometimes include inefficient regex patterns or overly broad logic, leading to Noisy classifier due to high matches, False positives and High scanning latency \n\nSimulation Mode mitigates these risks by allowing you to validate classifier quality and performance before publishing, helping ensure healthy, performant, and more precise classification outcomes. <br>GA date: December CY2025"
