  "Description": "Today, IT admins manually review trust data for Teams apps and agents in the Teams admin center to ensure they meet organizational security, privacy, and compliance standards. This feature introduces a scalable, automated evaluation process. Admins can define their organization’s trust requirements once, and the system will automatically assess each app and agent—generating a Trust Score and detailed evaluation report tailored to those requirements. This enables faster, more consistent decision-making by clearly identifying which apps and agents meet the organization’s standards and where further review is needed.<br>GA date: February CY2026",
