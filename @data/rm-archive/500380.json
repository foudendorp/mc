  "Description": "We are updating private channels to align with compliance model for all channels. After this change, compliance policies applied to the team (M365 Group) will apply to all channels in the team - across standard, private, and shared. Private channels will no longer need user level targeting of policies different from other channels, and private channel compliance messages will no longer be copied to user mailboxes, relying on a dedicated, internal mailbox per channel like shared channels. In addition, limits for private channels will be increased so each team can have more than 30 private channels, up to the 1000 total channel limit per team. Private channel member limits will increase from 250 to 5000. You will also be able to schedule meetings in private channels.\n<br>GA date: September CY2025",
