  "Description": "We're excited to announce an upcoming feature to enhance our Microsoft 365 offerings with a new, innovative auto-claim policy for Microsoft Loop and Microsoft Clipchamp. These two applications can be configured as a policy, allowing users with active base offerings like Microsoft 365 E3/E5 Original SKUs to automatically claim a Microsoft 365 Extra Features E3/E5 license when needed. As they engage with Microsoft Loop and Microsoft Clipchamp, a license from your tenant's pre-provisioned Microsoft 365 Extra Features E3/E5 SKU will be seamlessly assigned to them. This new feature is designed to simplify admin tasks and requirements.<br>GA date: April CY2024"
