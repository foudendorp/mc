  "Description": "To improve privacy, when transcription is off, captions will now show only the past five minutes of dialogue instead of the full meeting. If transcription is on, captions display the entire conversation, just like with live transcription. We’re also fixing an issue where changing the caption position could cause data loss—now, moving captions will not affect the text shown. These updates also apply to Real-time Text (RTT), ensuring a consistent and reliable experience.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
