Authors and co-authors will be able to manually assign or edit sensitivity labels on forms, ensuring that only users with appropriate permissions can access form design and response pages. Sensitivity labels will also be inherited by Excel files generated from Forms, maintaining consistent data protection across exported content.<br>GA date: December CY2025",
