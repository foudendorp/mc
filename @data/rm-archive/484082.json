We recommend reviewing collection policies as they can be created by different Purview solution admins to ensure they are setup to detect the activities required by IRM policies\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.
