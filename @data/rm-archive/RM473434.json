  "Description": "We’re introducing a new organizer-level control that no longer requires all meetings to have one common spoken language to be set across all participants. Meeting organizers with Copilot or Teams Premium licenses will see a new control in meeting options called “Enable multilingual speech recognition.” When this is enabled before a meeting, each meeting participant will be able to set their own spoken language during the meeting, and the meeting transcript can accurately reflect each participant’s language of choice. <br>GA date: April CY2025",
