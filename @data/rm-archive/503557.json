  "Description": "Agents & bots in group chats will now be able to authenticate through Entra. When an app requests a user's Entra token in a group chat, if that user does not have the app installed or Entra consent, they are sent a targeted message. This targeted message is only visible to that user. This message serves two purposes: to ask the user to install the Teams app personally and to open the Entra permission consent dialog. Once both requirements are met, the app can leverage Entra for the requested permissions (e.g., Graph).<br>GA date: November CY2025",
