  "Description": "Detection, processing and storage of interactions done on Enterprise AI and AI applications such as Security Copilot, Copilot Studio and others under Microsoft Purview Data Compliance solutions including Data Lifecycle Management, eDiscovery, and Communication Compliance will begin using a pay-as-you-go pricing model on May 1 in preparation for general availability. Microsoft Purview Audit will only use pay-as-you-go pricing for audit logs related to non-Microsoft Enterprise AI and AI applications. Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat data (with or without a Copilot license) will not be impacted by these new pay-as-you-go meters. \nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (for example SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to ensure user-level privacy. \n<br>GA date: June CY2025<br>Preview date: May CY2025"
