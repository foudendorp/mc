  "Description": "IT administrators will now have the ability to access detailed logs for both the \"Give and Take Control\" and \"Screenshare\" features. These logs will provide comprehensive information, including the names and timestamps of the individuals involved in each action. Specifically, the logs will indicate who initiated or received control, as well as who started the screenshare session, along with the corresponding timestamps and names. This enhancement ensures greater transparency and accountability for all control and screenshare activities. Accessible in Teams Admin Centre. <br>GA date: July CY2025",
