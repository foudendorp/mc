  "Title": "Microsoft Viva: Group-less campaigns in Viva Amplify",
  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "481155",
  "Description": "We are streamlining the campaign management experience in Viva Amplify and campaigns will no longer be tied to M365 groups. As such, M365 Group admins will no longer be a required role to configure Viva Amplify and only SharePoint admin role will be required. Also, when you create a campaign, there will no longer be a campaign channel tied to the Viva Amplify campaign, simplifying the campaign creation experience.<br>GA date: June CY2025"
