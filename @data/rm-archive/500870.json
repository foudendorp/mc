  "Description": "We're updating the SharePoint document library experience to more closely align with the user experience in OneDrive - while making it easier than ever before to access the valuable functionality unique to document libraries. When you’re working in a document library, we’ve brought custom views and filters front and center – just like in OneDrive. We’ve also redesigned the command bar to help you take action, faster. All your view customization tools are now grouped under one simplified menu, making it easy to apply conditional formatting or organize items by metadata in seconds.<br>GA date: November CY2025"
