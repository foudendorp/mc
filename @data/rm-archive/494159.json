  "Description": "Site attestation policy is the newest addition to the site lifecycle management suite. It is a one-stop solution to ensure your sites are secure and compliant by reducing the risk of unmanaged sites. This involves regular reviews by site owners or admins to check and confirm the accuracy of site information, including the site's necessity, its owners, members, permissions, and sharing settings. You can also choose to automate actions on sites that remain unattested for more than 3 months to prevent risks of content over exposure. <br>GA date: August CY2025"
