  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "366697",
  "Description": "In our continued efforts to enhance classification capabilities, we have added a new feature, Word-Breaker, to our existing Thai Language support in Classification. Words in Thai language sentences do not have spaces between them. And for classification purpose, we relied on the right keywords to be added while creating Sensitive Information Type for ensuring accurate match. However, with this feature, spaces will be added automatically in keywords which will ensure higher match accuracy across all cloud locations (Exchange, Teams, One Drive, SharePoint).<br>GA date: June CY2025<br>Preview date: June CY2025"
