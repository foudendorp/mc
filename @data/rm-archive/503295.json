  "Description": "We're expanding the capability to require explicit consent for recording and transcription to include 1:1 calls in Microsoft Teams. A new setting in the Teams Calling policy allows admins to enforce this requirement before recording or transcription can begin. When a user with the policy initiates recording, transcription, or both in a 1:1 call, the other participant is automatically muted, with their camera and content sharing turned off. The participant will see a prompt asking whether they consent to be included in the recording and transcription.<br>GA date: January CY2026",
