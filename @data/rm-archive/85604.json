  "Description": "Currently in public preview, Communication Compliance integration with Power Automate allows organizations to configure Power Automate flows to automate tasks for Communication Compliance cases and users. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. This item is no longer accurate and is being removed from the roadmap.  We apologize for any inconvenience. <br>More info: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance?view=o365-worldwide<br>GA date: April CY2025",
