  "Description": "Organizational Data in Microsoft 365 now allows administrators to upload historical HR data manually via CSV files. A new toggle in the upload experience lets admins specify whether the data is current or historical. For historical uploads, admins can assign an effective date to the file, ensuring accurate ingestion and processing by downstream apps like Viva Insights. This update improves data consistency across M365 and Viva apps and supports retroactive updates for organizational reporting.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
