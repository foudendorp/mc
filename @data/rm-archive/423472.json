  "Description": "This feature provides a visual optimization status indicator in Teams for VDI users. It will provide the user with an easy to understand status message (like â€˜Optimized', or 'Not Optimized'), some contextual information about the optimization mode (optimized with the WebRTC-based solution or the new SlimCore-based solution), and in the not optimized case it will provide a brief description of the problem and an error code, for better supportability. It will also provide an option to repair Teams optimization mode if the user is not optimized (through a restart).<br>GA date: February CY2025"
