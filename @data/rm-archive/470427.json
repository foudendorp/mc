  "Description": "After further review, this feature continues rolling out. We apologize for any inconvenience.\nTogether mode will get a new simplified flow which will take the user from the beginning to the end through the steps of setting up the scene, assigning the seats and applying for everyone in the call in a transparent and easy-to-understand way. The function itself does not change but there will be more transparency thanks to the icons on the meeting toolbar for an easy access for each next step in the familiar Together mode flow.<br>GA date: February CY2025",
