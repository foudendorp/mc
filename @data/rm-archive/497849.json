  "Description": "Press and hold Win + C keys, or the dedicated Copilot key for applicable devices, and the Microsoft 365 Copilot app will activate voice. With voice, talk to Copilot like a personal assistant - interrupting and redirecting at any time to prepare for the workday, create documents, understand topics, and search for information. This shortcut to activate voice means you don't have to switch between screens to talk with Copilot. Enterprise-grade security and compliance are built in, so conversations stay private while productivity soars.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
