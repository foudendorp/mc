  "Description": "Each channel can have a dedicated agent that draws on the channel’s knowledge to act as a domain expert for the team. New enhancements enable the agent to use files from the channel’s SharePoint when responding to queries, create ad hoc status reports configured through natural language, and generate new workback plans that can be added to Planner. In addition, new controls in Teams Admin Center allow admins to disable automatic agent creation.<br>GA date: November CY2025",
