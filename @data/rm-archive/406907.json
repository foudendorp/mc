  "Description": "Enrollment time grouping for iOS/iPadOS automated device enrollment (ADE) ensures targeted apps and policies can get to devices faster and reduce latency of device setup. ETG will only be part of new iOS/iPadOS enrollment policies. Admins can add a static Entra ID group into the enrollment policy, so devices will be part of that group upon enrollment, reducing latency of targeted policies and apps. <br>GA date: August CY2025"
