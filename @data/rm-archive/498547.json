  "Description": "Sections with Copilot is a new SharePoint authoring tool that allows users to create full-fidelity SharePoint sections with just a prompt. It works by first looking at the context of your page to offer prompt suggestions for what content you need next to offer a starting point. Next, you either select one of those starting points or write your own and optionally ground in a relevant file.\n \nOnce you click generate, Sections with Copilot then leverages the knowledge and content already inside of your organization and on your page to create rich sections that go beyond just image and text. This could mean meeting transcripts, recent documents, or any other knowledge Copilot has access to, added to an existing page with a click of a button. \n \nIf the output section isn't quite right, you can then use AI refinement to make changes to both the content and layout of your section, without ever touching our traditional authoring tools. Some examples include \"change the background image\", \"add John Smith's contact information\", or \"make the text more professional\". You can also get different suggestions by clicking \"regenerate\" and then choosing your favorite one to refine further. With Sections with Copilot, you can create content faster than ever before, no matter your SharePoint skill level. <br>GA date: August CY2025",
