  "Title": "Microsoft Purview: Inline data security controls (DLP) for file uploads to unmanaged GenAI apps in Edge for Business",
  "Description": "Inline protections for file upload protection are directly integrated into for Edge for Business to help prevent data leakage when users upload files to consumer GenAI apps in the browser. In addition to existing text upload controls in Purview collection and DLP policies, Admins can now detect and enforce inline protections on file uploads. Policies can target file-specific conditions such as file size, file type, and sensitive information types, enabling organizations to audit or block activities for users in Edge on Intune-managed Windows devices.<br>GA date: December CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2025",
