  "Description": "SharePoint Online Tenant Administrators can now allow script sources for modern pages in SharePoint sites. This is particularly useful in scenarios where modern pages have custom code that load scripts (e.g. TypeScript code) from external sources like CDN. SharePoint will now report to administrators where are loaded from sources that have not been allowed giving administrators a way to identify those sources and take actions. Tenant Administrators can also enforce browsers to only load scripts from allowed sources. This behavior can be enabled using SharePoint Online Management Shell.<br>GA date: April CY2025",
