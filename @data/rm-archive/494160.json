  "Description": "We are introducing a new set of enhancements to the modernized eDiscovery user interface aimed at improving both functionality and user experience. These updates include the ability to delete searches and direct exports; bulk add data sources and populate the custodian field for items in review sets and exports. We are also rolling out a tenant-level premium feature toggle to provide greater administrative control. Additionally, users will benefit from a new analytics process report and improvements to the search condition builder, which now supports logical operators such as AND, OR, and NEAR for more precise and flexible keyword queries, along with country and language selection for the query. The ability to configure the maximum export package size, with an updated default value to better support large-scale exports is also included.<br>GA date: June CY2025",
