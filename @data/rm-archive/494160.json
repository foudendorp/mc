These updates include the ability to delete searches; bulk add data sources and populating custodian field value for items in review sets and exports. We are also rolling out advanced indexing enhancements, along with a tenant-level premium feature toggle to provide greater administrative control. Additionally, users will benefit from a new analytics process report, and improvements to the search condition builder that now supports logical operators such as AND, OR, and NEAR, enabling more precise and flexible keyword queries.<br>GA date: June CY2025",
