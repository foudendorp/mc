  "Description": "IRM admins can now select DLP alerts as indicators in IRM policies. IRM admins can select DLP policies that they would like to bring into IRM. By enabling this indicator, admins can detect if a user has alerts for the pre-selected DLP policies.

This feature will help admins view this information within IRM itself without having to switch to DLP.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.
