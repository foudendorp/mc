  "Title": "Microsoft Copilot (Microsoft 365): Generate icons for your agents using AI in Microsoft 365 Copilot",
  "Description": "A picture is worth a thousand words. Before, Microsoft 365 Copilot agent builders would need to use the default icon or manually upload their own image. This process meant browsing the web for an image, asking different teams for icons, or manually drawing one. Users can now use AI to describe how the icon should look like, thus helping inform end users of the agent's function more easily, with more expression. Users can now generate icons using AI in Agent Builder. Users can enter custom prompts or use the description of the agent to generate the icon. Alternatively, users can manually upload their own icon or select from a set of pre-created icons. Icons are capped at 1 MB (192px).<br>GA date: November CY2025",
