  "Description": "We will modernize the existing email subscription management experience in Viva Engage to make it more user-friendly and intuitive. Previously, unsubscribe and notification settings links in emails opened legacy web pages with limited functionality. After this update, those links will direct users to refreshed, modern pages where they can easily manage their email preferences. Users will be able to unsubscribe or resubscribe to specific email types in a cleaner and more accessible experience. <br>GA date: May CY2025",
