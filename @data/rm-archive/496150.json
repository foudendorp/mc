  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Noise Suppression for Dial-In Participants in Teams Audio Conferences",
  "Description": "Microsoft Teams will soon support noise suppression for dial-in participants. This feature automatically filters out background noise (e.g., traffic, typing) for users who join meetings via phone (PSTN). It enhances clarity and reduces distractions for all meeting participants. The feature will be rolled out gradually. However, if you'd like to enable it yourself, you will be able to do so via the Teams Admin Center:\n1. Go to Meeting policy 2. Navigate to the Audio & video section 3. Set Noise suppression for dial-in participants to Enabled or programmatically with MicrosoftTeamsPowerShell by setting NoiseSuppressionForDialInParticipants setting inside of CsTeamsMeetingPolicy to \"Enabled\".<br>GA date: September CY2025",
