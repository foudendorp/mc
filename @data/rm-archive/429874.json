  "Id": "429874",
  "Description": "If a tenant has the (EnableAllOcsiClients) GPO enabled, Office and OneDrive are able to communicate smoothly. Right now, tenants have the option to disable the GPO, and when they disable the GPO, it becomes difficult to ensure that all internal versions of Office files are kept up to date so that features like autosave, version history, real time user collab, and merging in the case of conflicts can work. <br>GA date: May CY2025"
