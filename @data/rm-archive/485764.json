  "Description": "After further review, we need to roll this back. We apologize for any inconvenience. Python in Excel allows you to bring the capabilities of Python directly into the Excel grid. As a part of this feature release, eligible users with access to Excel for the web will be able to add Python formulas directly into their workbooks without any installation required. These Python formulas will be run by Excel in a secure container on the Microsoft Cloud with enterprise-level security as a compliant Microsoft 365 connected experience.\n\n<br>GA date: July CY2025",
