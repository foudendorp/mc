  "Description": "Sequential signing enables the creator of an eSignature request to specify the sequence of recipients. The document is first signed by the initial recipient in the sequence, then forwarded to the subsequent recipient for their signature. This process continues in the designated order until every recipient has added their signature. Once everyone has signed, the signed document is made available to all involved.<br>GA date: June CY2024",
