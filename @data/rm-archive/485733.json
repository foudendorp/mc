  "PubDate": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:15:28 Z",
  "Description": "This new capability further integrates SharePoint Online with Purview sensitivity labeling. SharePoint Online document library owners can set a new type of default label on the library, which automatically applies that label to all unprotected Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files within the library. This simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization, enriches DLP and Copilot with signal to allow admins to monitor and restrict access to this content, and enables inheritance of sensitivity labels to output artifacts in Copilot.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
