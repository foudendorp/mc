  "Description": "To address the issue of unauthorized screen captures during meetings, the Prevent Screen Capture feature ensures that if a user attempts to take a screen capture, the meeting window will turn black, thereby protecting sensitive information. This feature will be available on Teams desktop applications (both Windows and Mac) and Teams mobile applications (both iOS and Android). For users joining from unsupported platforms, they will be placed in audio-only mode to maintain the integrity of the meeting's content.<br>GA date: September CY2025"
