  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Usability and privacy improvements for live captions and live transcript in meetings",
  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "495454",
  "Description": "Introducing enhancements to live captions and live transcripts in Microsoft Teams to make meetings more intuitive, accessible, and privacy-focused. Live captions are now scrollable, allowing users to review past conversation with more flexibility and over a larger surface area. Next, copying captions is disabled by default to protect sensitive information and support compliance. Additionally, the live transcript panel won’t open automatically with features that trigger transcription—like recording, giving users greater control over their layout. Lastly, If transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the live transcript panel will see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions for real-time comprehension. These updates streamline the experience while supporting accessibility and privacy.<br>GA date: July CY2025"
