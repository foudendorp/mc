  "Description": "Microsoft 365 will introduce new Graph API endpoints designed to empower IT administrators and developers with robust programmatic access to app and agent management across Copilot, Teams, Outlook, and other MetaOS hosts. \nKey Features: \n•\tInventory API: Retrieve a comprehensive inventory of all apps and agents within your tenant, with advanced filtering by type (1P, 3P, LOB, Shared), host (Copilot, Outlook, Teams, Office), last updated date, and more. This enables bulk management, compliance checks, and streamlined governance for large organizations.  \n•\tDetails API: Access detailed metadata for any specific app or agent, including availability, deployment status, supported hosts, creator information, version, sensitivity, categories, and capabilities (such as Graph connectors, knowledge sources, and plugin actions). This supports auditing, lifecycle management, and integration into existing IT workflows. #copilotcontrolsystem<br>GA date: November CY2025",
