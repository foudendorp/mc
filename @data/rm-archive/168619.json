  "Description": "The Files On-Demand options of “Always keep on this device” and “Free up space” will soon be made available on OneDrive for Web for your synced files. You will be able to select files and folders to be always available offline on your device directly from within the browser without having to navigate away to File Explore or Finder to perform this action. OneDrive will download these, and they'll take up space on your computer. You will also be able to “Free up space” by selecting a file or folder that you previously marked as &quot;Always keep on this device&quot;, and they will no longer take up local storage space.<br>GA date: February CY2024<br>Preview date: November CY2023",
