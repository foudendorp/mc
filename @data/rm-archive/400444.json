  "Description": "Organizations can use insider risk levels in their Conditional Access policies. This includes some minor experience changes in the Adaptive Protection tab in Insider Risk Management, including adding total counts for Conditional Access policies that use Adaptive Protection and new user insights in the user activity timeline when a user is added or removed from an insider risk level. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: March CY2025",
