  "Description": "Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (IRR) enables customers to control the routing of inbound emails to comply with regional data regulations. Using IRR, customers can set the geo-region that inbound mail should be routed to for specific Accepted Domains. By setting Accepted Domains to specific geo-regions and then adding users to that Accepted Domain that are located in the same geo-region as the Accepted Domain is set to route mail to, IRR ensures that emails are fully processed and stored in the user's region. This keeps data within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), enhancing data sovereignty and compliance.<br>GA date: October CY2025<br>Preview date: August CY2025"
