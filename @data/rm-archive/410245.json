  "Description": "Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (IRR) enables customers to control the routing of inbound emails to comply with regional data regulations. Using IRR, customers can set the geo-region that inbound mail should be routed to for specific Accepted Domains. By setting Accepted Domains to specific geo-regions and then adding users to that Accepted Domain that are located in the same geo-region as the Accepted Domain is set to route mail to, IRR ensures that emails are fully processed and stored in the user's region. This keeps data within the userâ€™s Preferred Data Location (PDL), enhancing data sovereignty and compliance.<br>GA date: October CY2025<br>Preview date: October CY2025",
