Say goodbye to the days of endlessly scrolling through folders to find that one elusive document. With our latest update, locating your files is now faster and more intuitive than ever before. Whether it's in your personal OneDrive, shared folders, or document libraries, our improved search feature allows you to seamlessly sift through your digital workspace from one centralized location. We've added new filters for different file types, ensuring you can pinpoint exactly what you're looking for and with the date filter, you can narrow down your search results to find files created or modified within a specific timeframe. We understand that searching within a folder or document library is important to you, and for that, we have simplified scoping options that will enable precise searches within folders, sites, or document libraries. We've also visually updated the interface with more metadata, ensuring you effortlessly identify the right files every time.<br>GA date: September CY2024",
