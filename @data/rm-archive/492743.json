  "Description": "The Exchange Online Moderation feature gives message moderators the ability to Approve or Reject sending a moderated message to its intended recipients via a special email message form that includes Approve and Reject buttons in the Outlook Desktop or Outlook on the web toolbar. However, the ability to approve or reject a moderated message currently isn't supported on Outlook for iOS, Outlook for Android, or Outlook for Mac. With this update to use Actionable Messages for moderation approval messages, moderators with mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online will now be able to approve or reject moderated messages via all the Microsoft email clients: from Outlook for Windows, Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS and Outlook for Android.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
