  "Description": "With this update, all exclusion features currently found under intelligent detections will be relocated to a new tab labeled &quot;Global exclusions&quot; within the insider risk settings. All previously added exclusions in intelligent detections will be migrated to this new tab.\nThe functionality of exclusions remains unchanged. Moreover, admins with appropriate permissions can now add exclusion via defined detection groups, which contain similar entities like domains or file types. This new tab is designed to enhance usability and offers a convenient way to access and manage exclusions.\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: October CY2024<br>Preview date: April CY2024",
