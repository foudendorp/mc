  "Description": "Copilot Conversations as Search Results: Users can now retrieve historical Copilot interaction, including chats from notebooks, agents, and the main Copilot chat interface, directly in the search results (SERP). Dedicated Data Source in Right Rail: A new entry labeled “Copilot Chats” appears in the right rail, allowing users to scope their search specifically to Copilot-generated content. Scoped Query Formulation (QF) Suggestions: When users select “Copilot Chats” as the active data source, the search box dynamically offers scoped QF suggestions tailored to that source. These suggestions help differentiate between session recall and prompt execution, aligning with user intent.\n<br>GA date: November CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2025",
