  "Description": "To help organizations manage metered consumption costs for SharePoint Agents and Copilot Tuning, we are introducing support for Capacity Packs in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC). This feature allows global administrators to use prepaid message subscriptions before incurring pay-as-you-go (PAYG) charges. Each Capacity Pack provides 25,000 Copilot messages per month, which can be allocated to Copilot Chat environments via the Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC). Once enabled, MAC will prioritize consumption from these prepaid packs and automatically switch to PAYG when the pack is exhausted. Admins can monitor usage in PPAC, including: • Total messages consumed • Remaining prepaid capacity • Message allocation per environment Key Benefits: • Streamlined billing setup in MAC • Reduced risk of overage charges • Automated environment provisioning for Copilot Chat • Improved cost visibility and governance<br>GA date: October CY2025"
