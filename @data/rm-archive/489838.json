  "Description": "IRM admins can now select any Communication Compliance (CC) Policy alerts as indicators in IRM policies. After this rollout, IRM admins can select any custom CC policies that they would like to bring into IRM and detect if a user has alerts for these CC policies. When an IRM alert is generated, admins can review if there are any alerts for the user within CC under the policies that are enabled as indicators. This feature will help admins and analysts view this information in IRM without switching to CC.\n\n \n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.
