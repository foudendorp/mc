  "Description": "With this update, any SOC analyst with the required customer-determined permissions can access an insider risk summary of user activities that may lead to potential data security incidents, as a part of the user entity investigation experience in Microsoft Defender. This feature can help SOC analysts gain insider risk context for a specific user and make more informed decisions on responses to potential incidents.\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: February CY2025<br>Preview date: April CY2024"
