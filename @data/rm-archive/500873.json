  "Description": "Documents that have been electronically signed will now be automatically recognized and tagged as “Signed” upon upload to SharePoint. This enhancement also applies retroactively as existing e-signed files will be updated with the appropriate tags. To give users more visibility and control, we’re introducing two optional metadata columns for document libraries: Electronically Signed – Indicates whether a document has been eSigned. Signature Provider – Displays the service used for the eSignature. This feature is available exclusively to tenants with eSignature enabled, helping streamline compliance tracking and document management.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
