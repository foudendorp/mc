  "Description": "The hide user messages feature is a user-level moderation control. It allows users to see fewer messages from other users, helping to reduce interactions that may be unwanted or inappropriate. Users cannot hide designated leaders, corporate communicators, or network/verified/Engage admins. The hide user feature is default on; admins can turn it off for their network in the Engage admin center.<br>GA date: January CY2026",
