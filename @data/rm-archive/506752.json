  "Description": "We are introducing a dynamic filtering experience in Microsoft 365 Copilot search that empowers users to refine their results more precisely by leveraging data source-specific filters in the right rail. When a user selects a data source from the right rail, such as Outlook, SharePoint, Jira, or Copilot Chats, the interface dynamically presents a tailored set of filters specific to that source. These refiners allow users to narrow down results based on attributes unique to the selected data source, such as item type, status, or semantic labels.\n<br>GA date: November CY2025<br>Preview date: November CY2025",
