  "Description": "Launch a pre-scoped Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case. When a data security admin identifies a risky user who needs deeper investigation, they can launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from an IRM case, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.\n<br>GA date: December CY2025",
