  "Description": "We’ve made it easier to manage files when employees leave—account cleanup emails are now more prominent, new filters help managers quickly locate key files, and the enhanced “Move and keep sharing” feature supports bulk transfers with consolidated notifications, making the process more efficient. Security and compliance in ownership transfer ensures sensitive data remains protected, access is properly reassigned, and regulatory obligations are met during employee offboarding.<br>GA date: June CY2025"
