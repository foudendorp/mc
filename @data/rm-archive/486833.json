  "Description": "This new Microsoft Teams Meeting feature enables secure collaboration between users separated by information barriers (also known as ethical walls) under strict compliance oversight. With this capability, meetings involving participants from restricted groups can proceed only when a designated meeting moderator—assigned by the compliance department—is present. If the last moderator leaves the meeting,  the meeting automatically ends. This ensures real-time compliance monitoring and maintains regulatory integrity during sensitive cross-barrier interactions.<br>GA date: June CY2025"
