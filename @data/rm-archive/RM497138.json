  "Description": "When Microsoft Edge is set as the default browser to open external links from applications, Microsoft Edge must determine which profile to open the links. Users can control which profile to use through the “Default profile for external links” setting. Applications such as Microsoft Teams or Outlook can also recommend a profile for the links. Currently, the user setting is prioritized over application recommendations. With this feature, the application recommended profile is given priority, instead of the profile selected in the setting. Admins can control the availability of the feature using the “EdgeOpenExternalLinksWithAppSpecifiedProfile” policy.<br>GA date: August CY2025",
