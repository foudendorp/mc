  "Description": "Communication Compliance is improving the capabilities and customization of policy alerts. Admins will be able to customize the alert frequency per policy as well as adjust the email alerts frequency and recipients within the policy creation wizard. \nMicrosoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (for example SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: January CY2026",
