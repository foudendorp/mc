  "Description": "This feature ensures that conversations are preserved even when users navigate away from a session. As soon as a prompt is submitted, an entry is immediately created in the navigation paneâ€™s session history. This allows users to leave the session and return later just as if they had never left. The update enhances continuity and reliability, making it easier to navigate without losing progress.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
