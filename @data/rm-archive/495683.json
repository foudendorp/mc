Comprehensive trace logs will be automatically recorded and stored locally on the devices, eliminating the need to reproduce issues when submitting investigation requests to Microsoft. It allows for the collection of detailed traces over extended periods (up to 90 days). While raising tickets to submit investigation requests to Microsoft regarding Microsoft Endpoint  DLP, customers can share enhanced diagnostic information with Microsoft without needing to reproduce the exact scenario.<br>GA date: July CY2025<br>Preview date: June CY2025"
