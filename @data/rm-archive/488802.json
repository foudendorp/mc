  "Description": "The refreshed desk booking experience supports desks configured individually or as part of a pool. It puts maps front and center, with support for fixtures, but continues to work without maps. The same experience will be accessible from the calendar (in New Outlook, Teams and OWA) and from the Places app (on the web, or as a Connected app in Teams and Outlook), and will adapt to mobile/small screens. #MicrosoftPlaces<br>GA date: August CY2025"
