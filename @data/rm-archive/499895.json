  "Description": "Weâ€™re introducing more flexible and precise targeting capabilities in Viva Engage, starting with Storyline Announcements. This new feature allows leaders and their delegates to define a custom audience at the time of posting, without relying on pre-configured Leader Audiences. Audiences can be built, and saved for reuse, using organizational attributes such as department, job title, or country, existing groups like M365 Groups, distribution lists, or security groups, and even individual users by name. This flexibility enables more relevant communication, helping leaders reach the right people with the right message. Notifications and delivery channels, including Teams and email, will continue to follow existing Storyline Announcement behavior, ensuring a seamless experience for recipients. This feature is designed to help leaders tailor communications to specific departments, locations, or groups, enhancing engagement and relevance across the organization.<br>GA date: November CY2025",
