  "Description": "Insider Risk Management Administrators will now be able to increase the CPU and GPU device resource utilization limit for all devices uploading Forensic Evidence clips in their organization. Forensic Evidence will now allow up to 31% CPU and GPU device resource utilization, up from the prior maximum limit of 5%. This enhancement reduces interruptions in the recording and uploading of clips.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: February CY2025<br>Preview date: October CY2024",
