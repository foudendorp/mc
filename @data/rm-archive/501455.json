  "Description": "We’re excited to announce two new Copilot skills in the SharePoint Admin Center:\n1. Step-by-Step Task Guidance\nCopilot can now walk you through the exact steps required to complete common admin tasks.\nExample: “How can I find sites that are potentially over-permissioned?”\nWhat to expect: Copilot will recommend clear, sequential instructions to guide you from start to finish.\n\n2. Multi-Criteria Site Search\nCopilot can help you find sites using multiple conditions at once.\nExample: “Find sites that have been inactive for more than 60 days and are shared externally.”\nWhat to expect: Copilot will generate a filtered list of sites that meet your criteria and suggest recommended actions.<br>GA date: October CY2025",
