  "Description": "In this update, we are adding the recently added email indicators in Insider Risk Management as triggers. 1.  Sending email with attachments to free public domains - Users will be brought into scope of a policy when business-sensitive data is potentially leaked from a work email account to a free public domain email, potentially leading to a data security incident.  2. Sending email with attachments to self - Users will be brought into scope of a policy when business-sensitive data is potentially leaked from a work email account to user's personal email account or emailing self, potentially leading to a data security incident. \nAdmins with appropriate permissions can enable these indicators from the settings page and use these triggers in the data leaks or data leaks by priority users template.<br>GA date: December CY2025<br>Preview date: July CY2025",
