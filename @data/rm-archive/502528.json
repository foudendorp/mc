  "PubDate": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 23:00:02 Z",
  "Id": "502528",
  "Description": "We are expanding the auto-remediation capabilities in Automated Investigations and Response (AIR) to fully automate the remediation of malicious similarity clusters. Earlier this year, we introduced auto-remediation for malicious URL and file clusters. Building on that foundation, this enhancement enables AIR to automatically approve all pending remediation actions it generatesâ€”eliminating the need for manual intervention and streamlining the response process for SOC teams. This advancement significantly reduces response time and operational overhead, allowing security teams to focus on higher-priority threats.<br>GA date: December CY2025",
