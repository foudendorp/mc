  "Description": "Administrators using the Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center who manage agents and apps that work across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 copilot will be able to apply their changes consistently across all these surfaces. Before this update, changes made through the Integrated Apps section in the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these apps on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 copilot; similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. With this change, app and agent availability  will be unified across Teams, Outlook and Microsoft 365 copilot.<br>GA date: November CY2025"
