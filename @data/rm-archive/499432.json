  "Title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Endpoint Data Loss Prevention -- Always-on diagnostics for macOS endpoints (Phase 1)",
  "Description": "This feature release ‘Always-on diagnostics’, captures critical diagnostic data from onboarded endpoint devices running on macOS for EDLP issue reporting. Comprehensive trace logs will be automatically recorded and stored locally on onboarded Mac devices, eliminating the need to reproduce issues when submitting investigation requests to Microsoft. It allows for the collection of detailed traces over extended periods (up to 90 days). While raising tickets to submit investigation requests to Microsoft regarding Microsoft Endpoint DLP, customers can share enhanced diagnostic information with Microsoft without needing to reproduce the exact scenario.<br>GA date: November CY2025",
