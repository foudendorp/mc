  "Description": "SharePoint users who are also Adobe Acrobat sign customers can initiate eSignatures directly from PDF documents. The eSignature request will be processed by Adobe and a copy of the signed document will be automatically saved in SharePoint after signing. This reduces the risks of potential data leakage that customers often report as they move sensitive documents between SharePoint and 3rd party eSignature platforms. Manual download or upload of documents will no longer be required when initiating the request or when saving the signed documents back to SharePoint for long term storage.<br>GA date: July CY2024"
