  "Description": "We’ve made some exciting updates to Viva Amplify's authoring experience that will take your content creation experience to the next level. With our latest release, Copilot is now smarter and more helpful than ever, leveraging your files, like Word documents, and even meeting content, to generate high-quality communications with ease. Here’s what’s new: 1. Smarter prompt tuning We’ve fine-tuned how drafts and rewrites are handled, resulting in clearer, better-formatted output that aligns with your tone and goals. 2. Create content from files and meetings You can now use Word and Excel files, or even meeting recordings, as inputs to help generate content. Whether you're working from a doc, a spreadsheet, or a conversation, Copilot in Amplify helps you turn ideas into polished messaging. 3. Unified content generation flow We’ve migrated to a common service that brings a consistent and scalable experience across all your AI tools in SharePoint and Viva Amplify. What's more, generated content now appears in real-time, making the experience smoother and faster. These updates are part of our continued investment in delivering an intelligent, seamless authoring experience.<br>GA date: August CY2025",
