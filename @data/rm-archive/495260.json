  "Description": "Often you may want to transition a conversation from an email thread to a meeting. Copilot helps you do this by being able to start scheduling right from the email conversation. It saves you time and effort by generating a meeting invite that's ready for you to review and send. When you click on \"Schedule with Copilot\" a meeting form will appear with a Copilot generated meeting title, agenda, and conversation summary as well as a pre-filled attendee list from the email thread and an attachment of the original email thread. This feature will be available in the new Outlook for Windows, web, Mac, and mobile. #newoutlookforwindows<br>GA date: June CY2025",
