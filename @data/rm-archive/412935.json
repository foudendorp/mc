Initially, the information provided will include results\nfrom individual M365 certification tests and evidence submitted by ISVs during\nMicrosoft's audit of their app or copilot extension. Additionally, for\nnon-certified apps, admins will receive details on data handling, security, and\ncompliance as self-attested by the ISV.<br>GA date: October CY2024"
