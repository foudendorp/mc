  "Description": "Insider Risk Management is releasing the ability to select multiple Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies as triggering events in a policy. Previously, admins could only select one DLP policy as a triggering event within Insider Risk Management policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: December CY2025<br>Preview date: August CY2025",
