  "Description": "Extend Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies and Insider Risk Management indicators to the network by integrating with your existing non-Microsoft Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution. This integration enables organizations to intercept and inspect traffic inline at the network layer and enforce actions based on DLP policy conditions. It helps prevent sensitive data from being shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, apps, APIs, add-ins, and more - including generative AI platforms, cloud storage, and content-sharing services - while managing alerts and incidents through Purview and Microsoft Defender. If configured, these signals also inform user risk indicators in Insider Risk Management.<br>GA date: November CY2025",
