  "Description": "First, spoken language is now automatically detected and updated across Interpreter, live captions, and live transcription when Interpreter is enabled, keeping all speech features consistent with the language being spoken - no manual setup required. When Interpreter is disabled, live captions and transcription will still work, but auto-update spoken language will not be available, which may result in gibberish or inaccurate content if participants switch languages during the meeting.  Next, a new “preparing” status provides clear visual feedback while Interpreter initializes, helping users know when the system is ready -especially important for multilingual meetings. Lastly, Interpreter settings have also been improved with concise explanations for each configuration and field, making setup easier and minimizing confusion.<br>GA date: December CY2025",
