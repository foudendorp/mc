  "Description": "Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) introduces the Security Copilot Alert Triage Agent in IRM that analyzes and prioritizes IRM alerts so analysts can understand and act on their most urgent alerts first. On top of prioritizing critical alerts for analysts to triage first, alert triage agent will provide a summary of findings to help users understand what are the riskiest activities that make this alert critical to review. IRM correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. IRM enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: November CY2025",
