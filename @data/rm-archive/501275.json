  "Title": "Microsoft Teams: Control External Access by Domain for Specific Users and Groups",
  "Description": "Gain granular control over external communication. By setting custom External Access policies, you can define domain allow/deny lists and assign them to specific users or groups - capabilities that were previously tenant-wide only (\"Teams and Skype for Business users in external organizations\"). Use this to pilot with a department, restrict highâ€‘risk roles to approved partners, or open federation broadly where appropriate. Example: Allow Group A to communicate only with a specific domain, while Group B can communicate with all external domains.<br>GA date: September CY2025",
