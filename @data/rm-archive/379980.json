  "PubDate": "Tue, 26 Mar 2024 23:15:09 Z",
  "Description": "The new Queues app is a solution for collaboratively handling customer calls natively in Teams. Starting with surfacing call queue calls, your team members can use the Queues app to handle inbound calls, be it PSTN or VOIP. They can make outbound calls on behalf of the call queues or auto attendant that they are assigned to. And they can review the call queue statistics and seamlessly collaborate with their lead and colleagues within the flow of work. Authorized users, with permissions from Teams admins, can monitor their call queues and auto attendants in realtime, generate reports on queue and agent performance, configure their call queues and auto attendants using Teams settings, and opt in or out their team members to optimize for business needs. This is a Teams Premium feature.<br>GA date: October CY2024",
