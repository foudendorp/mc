  "Description": "Introducing a new feature that brings interactive agents into your Teams meetings and 1-on-1 calls. Engage with agents as a group or privately, with zero state prompts and history support for seamless interactions. Currently, only agents built on Copilot support sessions, meaning they can remember the context of previous interactions within the same session for more relevant responses. Custom agents do not yet have session support. All agents from BizChat/Copilot Studio are now available for use in your meetings and calls. This feature allows secure testing and iteration, inviting colleagues for feedback without affecting sensitive data or production channels.<br>GA date: June CY2025",
