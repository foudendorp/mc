  "Description": "HTTPS-First Mode in Microsoft Edge automatically upgrades HTTP connections to HTTPS when possible.  If a site doesn’t support HTTPS, Microsoft Edge shows a warning to highlight the security risk. This appears only for public sites—not private ones or manually entered HTTP URLs. Users can enable the warning in edge://settings and admins can control availability to this feature using the HttpsOnlyMode policy.  <br>GA date: September CY2025",
