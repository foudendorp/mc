  "Description": "We’re excited to announce UX improvements to the DLP Alerts Portal in Purview to help you triage incidents faster and more efficiently. What’s New: 1. Unified View: Events related to each alert are now available directly on the alerts page — no need to switch to new tab or drill down. 2. Faster Access: Access event details (e.g. Impacted assets) with just 1 click on the main alerts page itself, compared to 4 clicks earlier, reducing triage time significantly. 3. Enhanced Context: We've added 4 new columns - Location, DLP Rule name, DLP Policy name, Rule Action to display key alert and event attributes upfront — giving you more visibility at a glance. 4. Performance Boost: Cache improvements to ensure faster load times and a smoother experience. These updates are designed to streamline your workflow, reduce response times, and give you the context you need — all in a single, efficient view.\n<br>GA date: November CY2025<br>Preview date: September CY2025"
