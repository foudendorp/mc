In addition to the tasks that the agent is automatically capturing during the meeting, users can ask Facilitator directly through the meeting chat to create, edit, and assign tasks, which sync to Planner. For tasks related to document creation, users can assign to Facilitator and it will draft the document based on the meeting discussion. Users can also ask the agent to create a draft document on a topic discussed in the meeting. <br>GA date: November CY2025",
