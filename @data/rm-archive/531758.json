  "Description": "Declarative Agents have been enhanced to interpret and ground responses using images embedded in files such as Word documents (.docx), PowerPoint presentations (.pptx), and PDFs. This capability allows the agent to extract insights from visual elements like charts, diagrams, and screenshots, ensuring that answers are not only text-based but also informed by graphical context.
