  "Description": "With this update, the generative AI apps indicators will be supported as triggers in Risky AI usage policy. With triggers, customers can define the conditions for bringing the user into the scope of a policy while the generative AI apps indicators are used to determine risk score.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.  <br>GA date: September CY2025<br>Preview date: July CY2025",
