  "Description": "When sharing the screen or content, the presenter will now be able to better keep track of the participants' activity during a meeting. The Improved Presenter Window shows up to four meeting participants (both video and audio), who are active speakers and who raised hands, as well as a preview of the content being shared. Meeting notifications appear in the middle of the screen for better visibility.  This gives presenters increased confidence and awareness of what is happening among participants during a meeting.<br>GA date: May CY2024"
