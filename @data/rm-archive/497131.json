  "Title": "Microsoft Viva: Introducing Viva Engage Role Management APIs on Microsoft Graph",
  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "497131",
  "Description": "We’re excited to announce that Viva Engage Role Management APIs in Microsoft Graph are releasing soon. These new APIs enable IT admins to programmatically manage Viva Engage-specific roles, including Corporate Communicator, Network Administrator and Verified Administrator. With these APIs, one can automate role assignments, retrieve role data, and streamline admin workflows across organization. Previously, roles such as Global Administrator, Yammer Administrator, and Knowledge Manager were already supported via Microsoft Graph through Entra. This update expands that capability to include all Viva Engage roles—bringing greater flexibility and control to your admin experience. The APIs are now available in beta version for allowing users to test and share their feedback as we prepare for the general availability.<br>GA date: August CY2025"
