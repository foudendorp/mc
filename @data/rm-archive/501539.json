  "Description": "With this update, Insider Risk Management will support the discovery of sensitive files and text shared to any cloud application or website (inc. GenAI) via network layer. This capability is based on integration with 3rd party network partners (with data being captured via network layer). Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>GA date: January CY2026",
