  "Description": "User-Based Aggregation consolidates DLP alerts by user identity i.e. a DLP rule violations, in a specified aggregation time window, of the same rule and single user will be aggregated into a single alert enabling quicker triage and remediation. Instead of reviewing alerts containing rule match events of multiple users, DLP admin can now analyze grouped DLP rule match events per user, gaining insights into repeated policy violations and anomalous behavior. \n<br>GA date: November CY2025<br>Preview date: September CY2025"
