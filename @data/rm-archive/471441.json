Simply type your prompt, and Copilot will generate a bespoke script, source high-quality stock footage, and assemble a video project complete with music, voiceover, text overlays, and transitions. This provides you with a first draft, which you can edit in the Clipchamp app. You can then export the video to mp4, which will be saved in OneDrive and count towards your OneDrive quota, ready for sharing. This feature is ideal for creating informational videos, video messaging, how-to guides, demos, and video presentations. Available on the Microsoft 365 Copilot plan.<br>GA date: April CY2025<br>Preview date: January CY2025"
