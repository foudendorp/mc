  "Description": "Through the new Feature Access management user interface, admins will be able to manage feature access settings directly in Microsoft 365 admin center. Feature access management allows admins to use access policies to manage which users can access specific features in Viva apps, so you can tailor your deployments to meet your local regulatory or business requirements. Previously, these policies could only be managed with Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets. After this rollout, admins can choose to use either Microsoft 365 admin center or PowerShell to manage feature access. Existing policies set for an organization will persist and can be managed in both places.<br>GA date: January CY2025"
