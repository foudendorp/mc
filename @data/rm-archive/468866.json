  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "468866",
  "Description": "For teams with shared call responsibilities, delayed simultaneous ring will ensure calls configure the intended recipient first, instead of notifying everyone the moment a call comes in.  This helps reduce noise and minimizes distractions â€”especially for roles like delegates and customer service teams.<br>GA date: February CY2025"
