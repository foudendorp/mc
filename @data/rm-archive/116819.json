  "Description": "We are expanding the existing ‘Who can record’ control for meeting organizers to include transcription. With this change, meeting organizers with eligible licenses will see a control called ‘Who can record and transcribe’ in the meeting options, which allows meeting organizers to select from three options: (1) organizers and co-organizers, (2) organizers, co-organizers, and presenters, or (3) No one. This way meeting organizers will be able to manage which roles can initiate recording and transcription for a meeting. This functionality will be available to Teams Premium and Copilot for M365 licensed users. <br>GA date: June CY2024",
