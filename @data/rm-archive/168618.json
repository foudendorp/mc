  "Description": "<div><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">This feature will allow you to launch OneDrive in your browser and view, sort, rename, move, copy, and delete files even without internet access. Additionally, for locally stored OneDrive files (those that are marked as “always available offline”) you will be able to open and work on these in your browser even if you are offline. All of the changes you make offline will be automatically synced back when Internet connection is restored.</span> </div><br>GA date: February CY2024<br>Preview date: November CY2023"
