  "Description": "OCR Cost Estimator allows you to estimate the potential cost for using Optical Character Recognition. This means that you will no longer be required to set up an Azure Subscription for billing first and can accurately estimate the cost you would have incurred while using OCR. This will help you to identify the optimal configuration settings for OCR as per your requirements. Cost Estimator can be used for 30 days and will not scan images for sensitive content.\n<br>GA date: October CY2025",
