  "Description": "On phone devices, users currently access Copilot Chat in Outlook Mobile via a tab at the bottom of their screen (or in Apps). Outlook is introducing a new Copilot Chat overlay experience, allowing users to chat with Copilot while continuing to interact with their email, calendar, and contacts. This overlay will be context-aware—understanding what the user is viewing—so users can ask Copilot about the content on their screen. \n\nUsers with M365 Copilot licenses will also benefit from Copilot’s ability to  draw on Microsoft 365 Graph to provide richer, more personalized responses. <br>GA date: September CY2025",
