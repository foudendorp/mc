  "Description": "We’re making it easier to keep your inbox clean and under control. Now, when you report an email as junk, you’ll also have the option to unsubscribe—if that’s available. This helps stop unwanted messages at the source and keeps your blocked list from getting overloaded. If unsubscribing isn’t possible, you’ll still be able to block the sender to prevent future emails. This update gives you more control and a simpler way to manage unwanted messages.<br>GA date: July CY2025",
