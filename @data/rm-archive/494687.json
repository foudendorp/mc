These updates replace previous Copilot Assisted Hour calculations and meeting metrics with unified “summarized or recapped” metrics, helping leaders better understand usage across their organization. The updated metrics are available in both the Copilot Dashboard and the M365 Copilot Impact report in Advanced Insights, with additional query support for Intelligent Recap meeting metrics. #copilotcontrolsystem<br>GA date: November CY2025<br>Preview date: September CY2025",
