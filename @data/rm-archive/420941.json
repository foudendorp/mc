It will provide a comprehensive overview of an organizationâ€™s sensitive data landscape, visibility into potential risks, and offer contextual recommendations to strengthen the organization's data security posture. The Data Security Copilot will serve as an intelligent AI assistant layered on top of data security analytics, supporting tasks related to administration, risk assessment, alert triage, and reporting. \n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.
