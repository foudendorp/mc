  "Title": "Microsoft 365: SMTP onboarding to App Role Based Access Control",
  "IsMajorChange": false,
  "Id": "498356",
  "Description": "We're simplifying how organizations grant applications permission to send email on behalf of mailboxes. Today, customers must manually assign permissions to each individual mailbox using PowerShell, which is time-consuming and inefficient. With this new capability, admins can assign the SMTP.SendAsApp role to an app through App Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), enabling group-based or scoped access to mailboxes. This eliminates the need for per-mailbox configuration and streamlines onboarding for SMTP clients using OAuth. Itâ€™s a scalable, secure, and modern approach to managing mailbox access for applications.<br>GA date: October CY2025<br>Preview date: October CY2025"
