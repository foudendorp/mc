  "Description": "At Ignite, Microsoft is introducing a major evolution of Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) to help organizations strengthen data security and confidently embrace AI. The new DSPM experience unifies visibility and control across traditional data and AI-driven environments, delivering outcome-based guided workflows that turn insights into actionable steps—so teams can prioritize risks and remediate faster. It brings AI observability, enhanced posture reporting, and intelligent Security Copilot agents to automate tasks like triage and policy management. Plus, Purview now extends coverage beyond Microsoft data with third-party signals from partners like BigID, Cyera, OneTrust, and Varonis, giving security teams a single, streamlined view of sensitive data across clouds and platforms. Together, these innovations make DSPM the central hub for managing data security posture in the era of AI. We are also extending Data Risk Assessments to Fabric and to item-level analysis with new remediation actions like bulk disabling of overshared SharePoint links.<br>GA date: April CY2026<br>Preview date: December CY2025",
