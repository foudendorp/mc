  "Description": "We’re expanding the Interpreter agent in Microsoft Teams to include real-time speech-to-speech interpretation for Teams calls. This brings the same functionality previously available in meetings to calls, enabling users to speak and listen in up to nine supported languages. Interpreter helps eliminate language barriers and fosters seamless collaboration across global teams. For a more inclusive experience, users can also opt to have Interpreter simulate their personal voice.<br>GA date: January CY2026",
