  "Description": "Organizations that do not currently use Microsoft Teams can now seamlessly join and present within Teams Town halls using their own video conferencing devices (VTC). By integrating Cloud Video Interoperability (CVI) capabilities into the event form, organizers and presenters receive join codes for their tenant. CVI presenters who join the call will automatically join and interact with other users in the green room prior to the event starting. This capability ensures all participants can see each other (and see the meeting video) without any limitations, providing a seamless and inclusive experience for everyone involved.<br>GA date: May CY2025"
