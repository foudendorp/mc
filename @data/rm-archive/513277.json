  "Title": "Microsoft Viva: Block posts with theme moderation",
  "Description": "Theme moderation in Engage will soon offer an option to block message creation if content aligns with a theme. This change expands on the previous release to monitor and mute content based on themes.\n\nWhen a theme is blocked, users will see a message explaining why their message can't be published. Users can edit or discard the message. \n\nAdmins and corporate communicators can control where blocks happen across storylines and communities. Leaders, corporate communicators, and network/verified/Engage admins cannot be blocked regardless of theme.<br>GA date: January CY2026",
