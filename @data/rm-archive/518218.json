  "Description": "Users have always been able to dial a phone number and add someone to a meeting. Now, meeting organizers can seamlessly consult and merge PSTN callers to active Teams meetings even if they are behind auto-attendants that require Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency, or DTMF, navigation. For example, you can connect with and consult a subject matter expert through an audio conference dial-in before adding them to the group discussion.<br>GA date: January CY2026"
