  "Description": "We are thrilled to announce a powerful new feature that allows tenant admins to select an existing SharePoint Online (SPO) site and backfill OCR for documents already present in the library. This means you no longer need to move all your documents to a new site to ensure they are OCRed and protected.\n\nWe plan to release a private preview at end of May, if you would like to enable this feature please reach out the feature team and we will enable the feature on your tenant.\n\nOnly files without OCR will be processed, ensuring efficient use of resources and preventing double charges for unchanged documents. This update streamlines your workflow, making it easier to manage and protect your documents.<br>GA date: June CY2025"
