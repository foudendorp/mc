We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. iOS Live Activities integration for Teams meetings on mobile allows users to view the live progress of a meeting at-a-glance from their lock screen. Real-time notifications with Live Activities automatically update in real-time so users can see when the meeting has started, when itâ€™s in progress, whether recording is on, when someone needs to be admitted from the lobby, and when the meeting has ended. Live Activities is for iPhones only (iOS16.1).<br>GA date: November CY2025",
