  "Description": "Copilot in Teams can analyze content shared on-screen during a meeting when recording is enabled. This, along with meeting transcript and meeting chat, enables users to ask Copilot to summarize or find specific information from screen-shared content (e.g., ‘Which products had the highest sales?’), consolidate insights across both the conversation and presentation (e.g., 'What was the feedback per slide?'), and draft new content based on the entire meeting (e.g., 'Rewrite the paragraph shared on the screen incorporating the feedback from the chat’). This works for any content shared while sharing your desktop screen (including but not limited to documents, slides, spreadsheets, and websites, irrespective of platform or app). Support for PowerPoint Live and Whiteboard in Teams will be available at a later date.<br>GA date: August CY2026",
