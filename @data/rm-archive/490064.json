  "Description": "Users have long been able to use personal Microsoft accounts with the OneDrive app on corporate Windows devicesâ€”unless restricted by admin policy. This new feature introduces a prompt only when a personal account is already signed in on the device, encouraging users to also sign in to the OneDrive app with that account. Administrators who have already restricted personal accounts on corporate devices can continue to manage this as before. Organizations that have already disabled personal OneDrive accounts on corporate devices with the DisablePersonalSync policy will not see this prompt. Administrators can also suppress it using the DisableNewAccountDetection policy. More information on configuring policies can be found here:<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-group-policy#manage-onedrive-using-group-policy<br>GA date: July CY2025",
