  "Description": "This new capability ties together SharePoint Online library permissions with Purview sensitivity labeling and protection. SharePoint Online document library owners can set a label on the library, automatically applying that label to all unprotected and unlabeled Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files in the target library. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library. This provides a more centralized information worker-managed permission model that also offers revocation capabilities at a user level, rather than per-document.Â <br>GA date: July CY2025"
