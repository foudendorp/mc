  "Description": "Users can now interact with an instance of a live streaming town hall instance in the same way they would a recorded piece of content when viewing via desktop or web. DVR functionality in town hall enables event attendees to pause and move forward or back within a town hall, navigate to any previously-streamed timestamp, and other abilities that make interacting with a town hall more convenient and makes it easier to digest the content being presented. This feature is available for all town halls regardless of the license assigned to the organizers.<br>GA date: March CY2025"
