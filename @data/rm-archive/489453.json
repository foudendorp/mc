  "Description": "We’re introducing a new activity pane in SharePoint Online to help users track and troubleshoot Content AI model processing. Starting with document translation and autofill, users will be able to view real-time status (in progress, completed, failed) for individual files, bulk selections, or the full library. Completed status will include enriched details like language codes, glossary usage, and column extraction counts. This new pane will eventually replace the current “processing status” column, providing a more consistent and actionable experience.<br>GA date: July CY2025",
