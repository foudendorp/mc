  "Title": "Microsoft Viva: Viva Glint admin can enable Copilot for the Company admin user role",
  "Description": "Viva Glint's Company Admin role currently prevents editing of any role permissions, including feature controls for survey program reporting. While this restriction helps prevent accidental disruption of critical admin capabilities, it has emerged as a significant barrier to Copilot adoption. Customers must create and maintain redundant custom roles solely to enable Copilot access for Company Admin users, adding unnecessary complexity to deployment and ongoing management. This feature update will allow Company Admins to enable Copilot for themselves at the Viva Glint client user role level via a new toggle in General Settings. This enables Copilot across all eligible recurring and ad-hoc survey programs without altering the permissions architecture of the Company Admin role at the program level. All existing Company Admin user role permissions remain locked to preserve critical admin safeguards. This targeted change preserves essential admin role safeguards while removing a key friction point in Copilot deployment. <br>GA date: July CY2025"
