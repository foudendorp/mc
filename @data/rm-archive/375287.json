These reactions will be present in the timeline to highlight the most important parts of the video and can be used for navigation. Also, owners of the video can see detailed analytics about when viewers are reacting to videos and have ability to disable the feature.  This feature was incorrectly updated to a status of rolling out upon preview availability.  We apologize for any inconvenience.<br>GA date: January CY2025<br>Preview date: June CY2024"
