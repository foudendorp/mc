  "Description": "App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can install Teams apps. First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to Teams app store. Second, admins can edit the availability of an app to 'All users can install', 'Specific users and groups can install', or 'No user can install'. This feature evolves the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. The app permission policies for existing customers are migrated to maintain existing app availability in the tenant.<br>GA date: January CY2026"
