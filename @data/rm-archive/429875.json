  "Description": "If a tenant has the (EnableHoldTheFile) GPO enabled, and the end users run into Office file conflicts, then end users can open the file in Office to merge changes. If a tenant has the GPO disabled, and the end users run into Office file conflicts, then OneDrive automatically creates a copy of the file in conflict. When tenants have this GPO disabled, it leads to end users potentially having to manually merge hundreds of conflicts because OneDrive automatically forks a file instead of allowing the users to have the option to merge conflicts in Office. The proposal no longer allows tenants to disable this GPO thus not automatically forking a file when in conflict for end users. <br>GA date: May CY2025",
