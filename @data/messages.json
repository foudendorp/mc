Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of the Microsoft Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and in alignment with the “Secure by Default” principle, we are updating default settings in Microsoft 365 to help you meet the minimum security benchmark and harden your tenant’s security posture. These changes target legacy authentication protocols and app access permissions that may expose organizations to unnecessary risk.\n</p><p>This is the first step in a broader effort to evaluate and evolve Microsoft 365 defaults through the lens of security best practices.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 and are expected to complete by August 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization</b></p><p>The following settings will be updated:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Settings</td><td>Impact</td></tr><tr><td>Block legacy browser authentication to SharePoint and OneDrive using RPS (Relying Party Suite)</td><td>Legacy authentication protocols like RPS (Relying Party Suite) are vulnerable to brute-force and phishing attacks due to non-modern authentication. Blocking this prevents applications that are using outdated methods from accessing SharePoint and OneDrive via browser. To use PowerShell to block legacy browser authentication, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.online.sharepoint.powershell/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">Set-SPOTenant</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Block FPRPC (FrontPage Remote Procedure Call) protocol for Office file opens</td><td>FrontPage Remote Procedure Call (FPRPC) is a legacy protocol used for remote web page authoring. While no longer widely used, Legacy protocols such as FPRPC can be more susceptible to compromise and blocking FPRPC helps reduce exposure to vulnerabilities. With this change, FPRPC will be blocked for opening files, preventing the use of this non-modern protocol in Microsoft 365 clients. To learn how to block the FPRPC protocol, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324509\" target=\"_blank\">turn on web content filtering</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Require admin consent for third-party apps accessing files and sites</td><td><p>Users allowing third-party apps to access file and site content can lead to overexposure of an organization’s content. Requiring admins to consent to this access can help reduce overexposure. With this change,  Microsoft managed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/manage-app-consent-policies\" target=\"_blank\">App Consent Policies</a> will be enabled, and users will be unable to consent to third party applications accessing their files and sites by default. Instead, they can request administrators to consent on their behalf. To configure admin consent, follow instructions here: <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2324703\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring the Admin Consent workflow</a>. Customers who have already blocked user consent, turned on our previously recommended consent settings, or applied custom user consent settings will not be affected by this change.<br>Admins can also configure granular app access policies, such as limiting user access to the application for specific users or groups. Learn more <a href=\"https://aka.ms/entra-app-access\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These changes are on by default and apply to all Microsoft 365 tenants. No additional licensing is required.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>We recommend the following actions:\n</p><ul><li><b>Assess current configurations:</b> As applicable, identify current configurations for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-legacybrowserauthprotocolsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">RPS </a>or <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">FPRPC</a> protocols.</li><li><b>Notify stakeholders: </b>Inform IT admins, app owners, and security teams about the upcoming changes.\n</li><li><b>Update documentation: </b>Ensure internal guidance reflects the new defaults and admin consent process.\n</li><li><b>Configure Admin Consent workflow:</b> If third party apps access is applicable for your organization, learn how to set up the workflow: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring admin consent workflow.</a></li></ul><p>Additional considerations\n</p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?

The system can perform this task for an app after a device reboot and periodically as system conditions allow.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late September 2025 (previously late July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>New tasks will be publicly visible in the Windows Task Scheduler.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Task Names: Office Startup Boost and Office Startup Boost Logon.</li><li>Task Description: This task ensures that Office applications can take advantage of preloading performance enhancements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Initial roll-out will be on Microsoft Word. We have no announcements to make at this time regarding support for additional applications.</p><p>Startup Boost is only available when your PC has enough resources to run without impacting system performance. This includes having at least 8 GB of available RAM, and at least 5 GB of available disk space. When Startup Boost is active, the scheduled task will not run immediately at login to avoid slowing down your PC — it will wait 10 minutes to ensure the system is in a steady idle state. Additionally, Startup Boost will be disabled when Energy Saver mode is active. Startup Boost only runs if you have launched Word recently, and if you have not launched Word recently it will automatically disable itself.</p><p>Startup Boost is an optional performance feature. It is safe to disable. When disabled, Microsoft Office applications will be fully functional but may take longer to load. Customers can disable Startup Boost entirely by preventing the process from starting. To disable the feature, use the in-app setting, e.g., <i>Word &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Startup Boost (under Start up Options)</i>.</p><p>Scheduled task entry in Task Scheduler:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/da011aba-1d94-42a5-8bb7-507075d26620\" style=\"width: 450px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>End-user UI to enable/disable Startup Boost in Word:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e038abb2-c032-48ed-a891-5bfcba1bad8e\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.&nbsp;</p><p>You can disable this Startup Boost task like any other scheduled task.

The Facilitator app will be on by default unless all apps are blocked by your organization. For use in meetings, Facilitator will be off by default, and licensed users will have the option to enable.

As a part of the security promise, you can discover, protect, and govern AI interactions with Facilitator through Microsoft Purview.

For example, if an organizer marks a meeting as highly confidential and turns on AI-generated notes, those notes will not be marked as highly confidential. The suggested workaround is to not use Facilitator in meetings where sensitive information will be discussed. This limitation will be documented in admin and end user documentation at release. Microsoft is actively working on meeting sensitivity label inheritance to notes and will provide more updates as they are available.\n</p><p>Learn more \n</p><ul><li>If you're using Microsoft 365 Copilot in your organization (with your work or school account): <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Admin documentation: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/facilitator-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Set up Facilitator in Microsoft Teams for collaborative AI notes - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn (will be updated before rollout)</a></li><li>User documentation (meetings): <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/automate-notetaking-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-37657f91-39b5-40eb-9421-45141e3ce9f6\" target=\"_blank\">Automate notetaking in Microsoft Teams meetings - Microsoft Support (will be updated before rollout)</a></li></ul><p></p>",

To ensure a smooth and clear conversation, participants may need to pause briefly after someone speaks, allowing the translation to fully process before responding. This helps maintain accuracy and ensures everyone stays on the same page. &nbsp;</li><li>Interpreter is not optimized for   meetings with rapid exchanges, interruptions, or overlapping dialogue, since the translation may take longer than the original speech, which can make it harder to follow the conversation and respond naturally. &nbsp;</li><li>Interpreter is currently available during scheduled or channels meetings in Teams.

With IRR, admins can configure accepted domains to route messages directly to a designated geo-region, ensuring that email data is processed and stored entirely within the recipient’s region—even if it differs from the tenant’s primary location. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements without compromising email delivery performance.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=410245\" target=\"_blank\">410245</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in early August 2025 and expect to complete by end of August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We expect to begin rolling out in early October 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>In-Region Routing (IRR) is disabled by default. If you do not plan to use this feature, no action is required.</p><p>For domains where you choose to enable IRR, the feature allows you to route inbound emails to accepted domains associated with specific geo-regions. When these domains are aligned with users located in the same geo-region, emails are fully processed and stored within the recipient’s region. This ensures that data remains within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), supporting stronger data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.</p><p>If your organization uses Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), retention policies, or eDiscovery, you may need to review and adjust those policies to ensure they align with the new regional routing behavior.</p><p></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Ensure that admins have the necessary permissions to manage accepted domains and access to either Exchange Online PowerShell or to the Microsoft 365 admin center.</li><li>Review your domain configurations and identify users located in secondary geo-regions.\n</li><li>Prepare to configure accepted domains with the new geo-region property.</li><li>Review the documentation for configuring the feature: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo | Learn</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We value your feedback and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. Please comment or contact us through the M365 Admin Center if you need any assistance.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing user data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Yes. Emails are stored in-region based on domain configuration.</li><li>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any Purview capabilities? - Maybe. Depends on how DLP or retention policies are scoped by region.</li><li>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities? - Maybe. Regional routing may affect reporting granularity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated July 9, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Microsoft Fabric will introduce two Preview features called Workspace-level private links and <i>Outbound access protection </i>at the Fabric workspace level. At the tenant level, the corresponding settings <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> and <i>Configure workspace level outbound network rules</i> will be in the Advanced networking section of the Fabric admin portal.The new tenant-level settings will be disabled by default. You (the tenant admin) can switch ON the tenant toggle in the Fabric admin center if you decide to make this feature available to your workspace admins. This will allow the workspace admins to configure Workspace-level private links and Outbound access protection. The workspace admin will then decide whether to configure these features at the workspace level.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in late July 2025 (previously late August).</p><p>We will communicate the plan for General Availability in a future post.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Feature 1: Workspace-level private links</i>\n</p><ul><li>Private links provide secure inbound connectivity to Microsoft Fabric. Workspace admins can set up private links in Microsoft Azure to connect to a Fabric workspace from a specific virtual network.\n</li><li>In Fabric, workspace admins can choose to block inbound public access to your data to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. During Preview, admins can block inbound public access with the public REST API, which does not require a workspace-level private link set up in Azure. The corresponding-level tenant admin setting <i>Configure workspace level inbound network rules</i> will be available in the Fabric admin portal at <i>Tenant settings &gt; Advanced networking:</i>\n</li></ul><p></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3b49f2b6-47af-4042-895e-bbb33dca04ba\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><i>Feature 2:</i> Outbound access protection<i> at the user workspace level</i></p><ul><li>Data exfiltration is a concern for many enterprises that store sensitive data in the cloud. When used with other networking features in Fabric, the <i>Outbound access protection</i> feature can help secure your data from exfiltration.  Workspace admins will be able to block all the outbound connectivity from the workspace. Once enabled, all outbound connections made by Fabric Spark artifacts from this workspace will be blocked. The only way to enable a connection is by first establishing a managed private endpoint (MPE) from the workspace to the destination. Workspace admins can control this feature in <i>Workspace settings &gt; Network security &gt; Outbound access protection &gt; </i>Switch on the toggle for <i>Block outbound public access:\n</i></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/4eeb53ca-0821-44b0-a4ee-248ff3830a0b\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><ul><li>In this Preview, we will support OneLake and these Fabric items: Lakehouse, Notebook, Environment, and Spark Job Definition.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case. \n</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-July 2025 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously mid-July).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance and organizational requirements.

Soon, Copilot will also allow users to choose how they want to listen: select one or two speakers, adjust the style from concise to playful, and tailor the length to short, medium, or long.

This update builds on our May 2025 release, which brought previously installed agents to the Copilot apps for iOS and Android. </p><p>A Microsoft 365 Copilot license is required to use this feature.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 (previously late June) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After this rollout, users can select the G<i>et agents </i>button or select an agent link shared in Microsoft Teams for iOS/Android or Microsoft Outlook for iOS/Android to install a new agent in the Copilot app. Some agents may appear with a <i>Coming soon</i> label in the install list.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We have introduced a new configuration option in Microsoft Purview called collection policies for targeted signal discovery and collection. Collection policies will allow administrators to fine tune the signals and data collected for Purview solutions at the tenant level. This includes specifying which Sensitive Information Types (SITs) are classified and what activities are collected on Windows endpoint devices.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=479760\" target=\"_blank\">479760</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-July 2025 (previously late June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Key benefits of collection policies</i></p><ul><li>Granular control: Align with regulatory, regional, and organizational requirements that specify what types of data can be collected. \n</li><li>Noise reduction: Focus on the most relevant data security risks by tailoring data discovery and signals to what’s important for your organization \n</li></ul><p><i>Purview solutions impacted \n</i></p><ul><li>Unlike traditional Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies, collection policies are designed to streamline discovery of relevant information, rather than apply enforcement or take action on that information. There is no action taken from these policies to block content, as policies are meant to scope what content is collected and surfaces to administrators.</li><li>Using collection policies to scope signal collection will impact what is surfaced in several Purview solutions, including Insider Risk Management (IRM), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Activity Explorer, and more. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Overview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release. If you choose to leverage collection policies, admins can now choose which signals to discover in devices.\n</p><p>After you enable collection policies, you may see various updates to the Purview DLP audit experience. These updates may affect your organizations current configuration in the following ways: \n</p><ul><li>Activities to audit on your tenant will be scoped to the selected SITs and user activities \n</li><li>A new Location picker experience will be used to scope users and groups \n</li><li>To use collection policies for endpoints, the DLP <i>Always audit </i>setting will still need to be enabled. However, once created, collection policies for endpoint devices adjust from an open policy to an allowlisting policy that supports inclusion and/or exclusion of specific users, groups, and specified activities to reduce load and address customer requirements. \n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default for admins to configure.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release until you create an initial collection policy and <i>Always audit</i> is enabled in DLP (Windows endpoint devices only).

      "Content": "<p>We’ve made several usability improvements to enhance live captions and live transcripts in Microsoft Teams — making meetings more intuitive, less distracting, and more privacy-conscious.\n</p><p>First, live captions will be scrollable, allowing users to review the meeting conversation without interrupting the live view. To help protect sensitive content and support compliance with data handling policies, copying text from live captions is now disabled by default. This ensures captions remain a real-time experience, reducing the risk of content being copied and shared out of context.\n</p><p>Second, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will no longer open automatically for the user who starts recording, which also triggers transcription in the background. Before this rollout, this panel only auto-opens for the person who initiates recording or transcription — not for other participants — but this can be distracting and isn’t always relevant to the user's intent. After this rollout, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will remain closed unless manually opened or the user explicitly starts transcription. This gives users more control over their meeting layout and helps avoid unnecessary screen changes during important discussions.\n</p><p>Third, when transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the<i> Live transcript</i> panel will now see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions instead. This helps guide users to the most appropriate feature for following the conversation in real time, improving comprehension and reducing confusion.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, and Teams for the web. </p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=495454\" target=\"_blank\">495454</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early July 2025 and expect to complete by mid-July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC High): We will begin rolling out late July 2025 and expect to complete by early August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (DoD): We will begin rolling out early August 2025 and expect to complete by mid-August 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>These updates improve usability, privacy, and accessibility in Teams meetings.

No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in May 2025 (previously April 2025).&nbsp; This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: After further review we have decided not to proceed with this change at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>This message replaces MC1024398<i> (Updated) Microsoft 365 apps: We will prompt users to back up their files in Microsoft OneDrive</i> (published March 2025, updated March 2025) and includes additional details. Please refer to this new post going forward:</p><p>Coming soon: Eligible users will be prompted in the Message Bar below the toolbar in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows desktops to enroll in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/redirect-known-folders\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM).</a> Users will be able to select the folders to back up in Microsoft OneDrive.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025. \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If your organization still has users who are not enrolled in KFM, the message \"BACK UP THIS DOCUMENT: Share and work with others in this and other files using OneDrive\" will encourage them to do it while using familiar desktop apps. After users select the Open OneDrive button, they can select the folders they want to back up in OneDrive:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ca81daa5-b315-416d-966e-bed4ff8723ea\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\">\n</p><p>When users are enrolled in KFM, the files in their enrolled folder benefit from the advantages of cloud files:\n</p><ul><li>Increased security and compliance: Enterprises can increase security and compliance, because all cloud files are subject to default classification, labeling, and protection (CLP) policies and auto-labeling. \n</li><li>Copilot support: Files are Copilot-enabled, making it simple and intuitive to access and leverage Copilot. (A Microsoft 365 Copilot license or a Microsoft 365 license is required to use Copilot.)</li><li>Easy collaboration: Cloud files enable sharing, commenting, and easy collaboration, with AutoSave ensuring changes are frequently and consistently saved. \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Cloud files can be accessed from Windows, Mac, the web, iOS, and Android with synchronized changes. \n</li><li>Backup: Protection from data loss due to device failure. \n</li><li>Access to cloud-specific features like AutoSave and Version History</li></ul><p>After enrolling, users can access their files in the known folders in File Explorer or OneDrive. \n</p><p>No action required. The feature will be enabled automatically for eligible users. If KFM is blocked in your organization, the message will not be displayed. \n</p><p>If an organization has blocked KFM, we will honor that and not display the message to the organization's users.\n</p><p>This Message Bar will not appear if:\n</p><ul><li>The user is already enrolled in KFM\n</li><li>The user doesn’t have OneDrive provisioned, installed, and running\n</li><li>The existing policy to block KFM Wizard (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy#prevent-users-from-moving-their-windows-known-folders-to-onedrive\" target=\"_blank\">Prevent users from moving their Windows known folders to OneDrive</a>) is enabled and deployed\n</li><li>The new policy <i>Restrict KFM from Office</i> is enabled and deployed\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration and notify users about the change, explaining the benefits of OneDrive and the sync process. Consider updating any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Based on your feedback, we created a new policy called <i>Restrict KFM from Office. </i>When this new policy is enabled and deployed, Office apps won’t show the Message Bar regardless of user eligibility. This policy is scoped only to Office apps and does not affect other OneDrive or KFM settings. This policy is available now in the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030\" target=\"_blank\">Administrative Template files for Microsoft Office</a> (version 5497.1000 or newer).\n</p><p>If you don’t want the message prompting users to back up their files to display to users in your organization, you can enable and deploy the <i>Restrict KFM from Office</i> policy.</p><p>How to deploy this policy:\n</p><p>If you use  Active Directory, Microsoft Entra or hybrid environments,  you can use <b>Group Policy Objects</b>. Group policy can represent policy settings in the file system or in Active Directory Domain Services. When used with Active Directory, Group Policy settings are contained in a Group Policy Object (GPO).

We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

Learners will continue to see the option to manually mark a course as complete when provider signals are unavailable.\n</p><p>If your organization prefers to restrict this behavior, admins can disable the setting from the Viva Learning admin settings page. When toggled off:\n</p><ul><li>A confirmation dialog will appear before saving the change.\n</li><li>The system will log the last modified date and the admin who made the change.\n</li><li>Learners will no longer see the “Mark complete” button on applicable courses, including those in Academies and Learning Paths.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>No immediate action is required. The setting will appear automatically in the admin settings page. If you wish to restrict learners from manually marking courses as complete, you can disable the toggle at any time.\n</p><p>For more information, please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/learning/set-up-viva-learning\" target=\"_blank\">Set up Microsoft Viva Learning in the Teams admin center</a>.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Teams: App centric management for admin app installation introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant has specific Teams apps preinstalled. Similar to app centric management for app availability, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023), admins will be able to install apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.</p><p>After rollout, app centric management will replace<i> Installed apps</i> in the Teams admin center and give admins the ability to install apps individually. The <i>Installed apps</i> in your app setup policies will be migrated to app centric management based on your current user and group assignments for each policy. The rest of your settings in app setup policies will remain unchanged and will continue to work based on app setup policies, including <i>Pinned apps</i>. After this rollout, you can install Teams apps for selected sets of users, groups, or all users in the organization, and <i style=\"\">Installed apps</i> in app setup policies will no longer be available.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=394274\" target=\"_blank\">394274</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>App centric management will roll out in four General Availability phases.\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out&nbsp;late July&nbsp;2024 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete late June 2025 (previously late May) phase applies to tenants who meet both conditions: 1) tenants with no <i>Installed apps</i> in the Global app setup policy and 2) tenants with no custom app setup policies created in the Teams admin center. After rollout, these tenants will have app centric management enabled for their app installs. Admins may see the <i>Manage apps</i> page in read-only mode for a short time.\n</li><li>Phase 2 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to all remaining tenants. This phase will migrate apps installed for users and groups through Installed apps in app setup policies to app centric management.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before the rollout: If you install an app to a user, the user cannot actually use an admin preinstalled app if you did not take the additional step to allow the user to use it. After the rollout, if you install an app through app centric management, the user will immediately be able to use the app.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Before the roll out, a user will only have apps installed from a single app setup policy, following the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/assign-policies-users-and-groups#precedence-rules\" target=\"_blank\">policy resolution precedence rules</a>. After the rollout, if you have multiple custom app setup policies assigned to users or groups, apps from every policy will be installed to&nbsp;the user or group assigned to&nbsp;that policy, regardless of the policy resolution precedence rules.\n</p><p>&nbsp;<b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action needed for Phase 1 tenants. We will update this message with more information before the rollouts for Phases 2 tenants.\n</p><p>You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

It is an advanced method of sending messages to your users and requires proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to ensure messages are delivered successfully.</p><p>Many customers do not need to use Direct Send. Because SPF protections do not always outright block messages and sometimes deliver them to the Junk folder, it is possible for malicious senders mimicking Direct Send to have their messages that spoof your own domains land in the Junk folder and potentially confuse your users. Before this rollout, no feature existed to block Direct Send traffic for customers who have no need to use it. We will roll out the new <i>Reject Direct Send</i> setting for Exchange Online.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out early September 2025 and expect to complete by early September 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Direct Send covers anonymous messages sent from your own domain to your organization’s mailboxes and so enabling this setting will block any of that traffic. Direct Send traffic may include third-party services that you have given permission to use your domain or one of your own email applications hosted on-premises. To avoid having these messages rejected when this feature is enabled, they need to be authenticated. You can authenticate them by creating a <i>partner mail flow connector</i> for these messages.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout has happened automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation.\n</p><p>By default, the new opt-in <code>RejectDirectSend</code> setting is set to <code>False</code>.  To enable the Reject Direct Send feature, Exchange Online admins can run this Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet: \n</p><p><code>Set-OrganizationConfig -RejectDirectSend $true</code>\n</p><p>The change should propagate out to your entire service within 30 minutes. With the feature enabled, any received Direct Send messages will see the following message:  \n</p><p><code>550 5.7.68 TenantInboundAttribution; Direct Send not allowed for this organization from unauthorized sources</code> \n</p><p>Unless you re-enable Direct Send, any messages that hit this error will need a partner connector created to authenticate their source as an approved sender.  \n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-more-control-over-direct-send-in-exchange-online/4408790\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing more control over Direct Send in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p><p>We invite Exchange admins to try out the feature and provide feedback that we can use to validate and proceed to offering this feature for General Availability.</p>",

Verified admins will no longer be able to enable or disable this feature.</p><p>There are alternative methods that can fulfill the needs previously met by private content mode:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Viewing private community content without being a member: Users with the Global Administrator or Groups Administrator role can search for private communities within Engage and join these communities without requiring explicit approvals. Learn more about other Entra ID roles <a href=\"https://Microsoft Entra built-in roles - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </li><li>Viewing community admins and members for private communities without being a member: Since Engage Communities are backed by Microsoft 365 groups, the list of group owners and group members are visible within Entra ID for all users. Learn more about group management <a href=\"https://Learn about groups, group membership, and access - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </li><li>Handling legal/audit cases in Engage: Compliance administrators, eDiscovery managers, and eDiscovery administrators can access, search, and export private community and private message content on Viva Engage. Learn more about our eDiscovery standard solution <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </li><li><b>Enable Supervisor mode when calling Yammer REST APIs</b>: If you rely on the Yammer REST APIs to programmatically fetch private community content, you may continue to do so by enabling supervisor mode, as <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/yammer/api-requests\" target=\"_blank\">documented here</a>.</li></ul><p>Admins are also able to perform <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/engage/eac-as-manage-data\" target=\"_blank\">network data exports</a> which can be manipulated to handle other advanced use cases.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>After June 30th, private content mode will automatically be disabled for all tenants, and if needed you would have the ability to enable it by calling the REST API as highlighted above.&nbsp;</p><p>There will be <i>no exceptions </i>to the retirement which will be done on June 30th, 2025.

Expect no further delays beyond this date. Please review the information below for more details.\n</p><p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) gradually beginning with a small percentage of submission rejections for all tenants on March 1st 2026 and reaching 100% rejections on April 30th 2026, (previously September 2025). After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>We will be making this change beginning March 1st, 2026, and completing April 30th, 2026 (previously September 2025).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center has been updated to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. Starting in July 2025, we will send monthly Message Center posts to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change.\n</p><p>Starting March 1st 2026 (previously September 2025) we will gradually start rejecting Basic Auth requests to the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints, increasing to 100% rejection by the end of the April 2026. \n</p><p>The Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints in scope for this change are:\n</p><p>•\tsmtp.office365.com\n</p><p>•\tsmtp-legacy.office365.com\n</p><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><p>•\t550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a>\n</p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before April 2026, previously September 2025:\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

Users without ExternalLookUpMode enabled will see a slightly different version of this in-app consent dialog that excludes emergency calling.

DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams.

Please continue to monitor your <a href=\"http://spo.ms/admin#/oneDriveAccounts/management\" target=\"_blank\">Unlicensed OneDrive Account report</a>, as all accounts listed will be subject to enforcement if no action is taken.  To support more informed decision-making, we’ve introduced new and more granular reasons for why an account may appear unlicensed but and has not been deleted. This added detail should help you take the appropriate actions for each case and will be available in your Unlicensed OneDrive Accounts report no later than June 24th.  In some cases, admin action is required to delete the accounts. The timeline for enforcement remains unchanged from our last update.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

These challenges are particularly noticeable for participants joining remotely, using assistive technologies, or communicating through different modalities.</p><p>Before this rollout, sign language users face several challenges during meetings, including difficulty locating and identifying their interpreters, as well as ensuring proper positioning of interpreter video feeds. Furthermore, active speaker detection prioritizes audio, resulting in participants who communicate through sign language often receiving less visual prominence than verbal speakers. These challenges make it more difficult for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants to remain fully engaged during meetings.\n</p><p>In Microsoft Teams, we are committed to addressing these gaps, with a particular focus on enhancing the meeting experience for Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who communicate using sign language. As part of our initial efforts, we are introducing Sign Language Mode. When enabled, Sign language users will benefit from an enhanced meeting experience. Interpreters will be clearly identified in the participant roster and visually distinguished throughout meetings. Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants who use sign language will be automatically detected and elevated to active speaker status, ensuring equal prominence with spoken audio participants. This will help create a more equitable and collaborative environment for everyone.\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop are required for sign language detection. Support for Teams for web will come later this year. Sign language detection will not work on mobile devices.

As shared in MC1041319, the Analyst and Researcher agents began rolling out in May 2025 to Microsoft 365 Copilot-licensed users under the Frontier program.\n</p><p><u>What's New:</u></p><p>Starting May 30, 2025, the Analyst and Researcher agents will be generally available for Microsoft 365 Copilot licensed users as part of the Copilot experience.\n</p><ul><li><i>Researcher:</i> Combines OpenAI’s deep research model with Copilot’s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities to help users tackle complex, multi-step research at work. It can simultaneously reason over work and web data, including third-party data via connectors or data pulled in from other agents, for its response.\n</li><li><i>Analyst:</i> Leverages OpenAI’s o3-mini reasoning model and is optimized to do advanced data analysis at work.

To enhance transparency and user control, Teams will introduce a new location consent experience that gives users the choice of when and how Teams can use their location data <b>specifically, the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/nativewifi/wi-fi-access-location-changes\" target=\"_blank\">SSID (service set identifier) and the BSSID (basic service set identifier</a>)</b>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early June 2025 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late May (previously early May).\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2025 (previously early June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>All new and existing Teams for Work users in your organization will be prompted to specify if they want to keep location detection on for emergency calls only or if they consent to allowing location access used for <i>IT Admin Insights</i>, for troubleshooting (with a tool such as the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/cqd-what-is-call-quality-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Call Quality Dashboard</a>) or for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/configure-dynamic-emergency-calling\" target=\"_blank\">Network and Location matching through BSSID</a> for emergency calling location.\n</p><p><b>NOTE: </b>The new Teams location consent flow does not apply to fully managed devices where users are restricted from user-granted location access.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available.

      "Content": "<p>Updated May 28, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Out-of-the-box agents are available within Microsoft 365 apps or Copilot Chat, adding specialized skills and knowledge while automating tasks at hand. They handle aspects from simple, mundane tasks to complex, multi-step business processes, working alongside individuals or on behalf of teams. Today, we’re announcing a new agent, Skill Discovery, and updates to agents available in public preview.</p><ul><li><i>Skills:</i> Available in June 2025, the new People Skills data layer will power a new Skills agent. Employees will be able to easily find experts in the organization, understand colleagues’ skills, and make informed decisions about skill development. Leaders will get support on strategic workforce planning decisions with an up-to-date view of talent landscape strengths, gaps, and opportunities.  For additional details on People Skills and Skills agent, please reference <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">MC <b>Placeholder for number &amp; link to People Skills MC post</b>\n</span></li><li><i>Interpreter:</i> The Interpreter agent allows each user to enable real-time speech-to-speech interpretation in multilingual Teams meetings so they can speak and listen in the language of their choice, instantly overcoming language barriers. Interpreter works best in structured conversations where one person speaks at a time for longer periods. Users can opt-in to have Interpreter simulate their voice, helping others identify them more easily and follow the conversation more naturally. Alternatively, users can opt to choose from a set of default voices. Interpreter is now available in public preview.\n</li><li><i>Facilitator:</i> The Facilitator agent works alongside you and your team in Teams meetings to enable more effective collaboration. During the meeting, Facilitator takes real-time notes, allowing everyone to co-author and collaborate easily. Now, Facilitator will also help moderate meetings by leveraging the set agenda from the meeting invite or identifying the goal from the meeting discussion. At the halfway point and before wrapping up the meeting, Facilitator will recap the decisions made and open questions, ensuring that important follow-up tasks and details are not missed. These two Facilitator capabilities are now available in public preview. \n</li><li><i>Project Manager:</i> The Project Manager agent in Planner automates project and task management for all your team needs. Project Manager can automatically create a new plan from scratch or use a pre-configured template based on goals and relevant files you input. It can also complete tasks, including content creation. Now, Project Manager can generate a status report for any project in a matter of minutes. Reports will include a project summary, the reporting period, potential blockers, and more to keep team members informed. Collaborate with your team to refine the report and share it across surfaces including SharePoint newsletters to reach a broader audience.  \n</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><ul><li>Skills: Will be generally available in June 2025.</li><li>Interpreter: Fully rolled out to public preview.</li><li>Facilitator: Public preview roll out of the new meeting moderation capability will start on early May 2025.</li><li>Project Manager: Public preview roll out of the new status report capability will start on late May 2025 (previously late April).</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do prepare:</b></p><p>Users must have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license to access Interpreter, Facilitator, and Project Manager in public preview. Beyond preview access, additional licensing details will be communicated prior to general availability. \n</p><p><i>Interpreter:</i></p><ul><li>Admins can manage access to Interpreter and configure the default behavior of voice simulation for users via PowerShell. For more information refer to the admin documentation here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/interpreter-agent-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Interpreter agent for your organization - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li></ul><p><i>Facilitator:</i></p><ul><li>The Facilitator app controls both AI-generated notes and the meeting moderation capability mentioned in this post. It will be allowed by default unless all apps are blocked by your organization. However, as an admin, you control whether Facilitator will be available to your entire organization or to a certain group of users. For more information, refer to our admin documentation here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/facilitator-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Set up Facilitator in Microsoft Teams for collaborative AI notes - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> \n</li><li>Facilitator capabilities require transcription and for the 'Allow Copilot' meeting option to be set to 'During and After Meeting.' Facilitator needs to be added within the first 5 minutes from scheduled start time to experience to full capabilities.\n</li></ul><p><i>Project Manager:</i></p><ul><li>Admins do not need to take action to enable the status report capability as it will be automatically available after rollout.\n</li><li>The status report capability will begin rolling out before a control in the admin portal to disable Project Manager is available. If you would like to disable Project Manager before the admin control is available, open a support request with Planner support and we can disable it on your behalf temporarily until the self-service option is available.

If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In mid-January, Microsoft Copilot will become available to users with an Entra account in Microsoft Teams and Outlook. If pinned, Entra users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app directly from the left rail in Outlook and Teams. On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header. Microsoft Copilot will also become available in the Store for users to add on their own, managed by the same admin settings used for app availability today. Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in February.</p><p>Note: During the rollout, the Microsoft Copilot app will temporarily be available for Semi-Annual Channel users of classic Outlook for Windows. These clients will respect admin and user preferences, but we typically do not show Copilot features in Semi-Annual Channel of classic Outlook for Windows. After customers update to Version 2408 or newer, the Microsoft Copilot app will once again be hidden for Semi-Annual Channel users.</p><p>In addition, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will have Copilot automatically pinned in the left rail in Teams, along with the Copilot chat that is automatically pinned in the Teams Chat pane for them today.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=420330\" target=\"_blank\">420330</a>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft 365 Copilot app will be pinned by default in the Teams left rail staring late January 2025 (previously mid-January)  and is expected to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January).</p><p> </p><ul><li>On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header.&nbsp;</li><li>Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in mid-February 2025.</li></ul><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft Copilot app will be available to install and pin in Outlook starting mid-February 2025 (previously late January) and is expected to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late February).

If you are currently following this guidance, <b>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain</b>. \n</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

Analyst uses chain-of-thought reasoning to progress through problems iteratively, taking as many steps as necessary to refine its reasoning and provide a high-quality answer that mirrors human analytical thinking. It can run Python to tackle complex data queries and users can view the code it's running in real time and check its work.</li></ul><p>Researcher and Analyst will start rolling out to users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license in April as part of a new “Frontier” program that gives customers early access to new Copilot innovations while they are still in development.

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 21, 2025: We have updated the timelines below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>To reduce the risk of misuse and abuse of Exchange Online resources and ensure service availability for all users, we’ll soon introduce new tenant-level outbound email limits, known as the Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit or TERRL. The TERRL restricts the number of external recipients a tenant can send email to per day. If the limit is exceeded further messages sent to external recipients from the tenant will be blocked until the volume for the last 24 hours drops below the quota. A tenant’s TERRL quota is calculated based on the number of email licenses a tenant has purchased. Here is the formula used to calculate a tenant’s quota:\n</p><p>500 * (Purchased Email Licenses^0.7) + 9500\n</p><p>To help admins plan and track their outbound email volume, you’ll find a new report in the Exchange admin center: <i>EAC &gt; Reports &gt; Mail flow &gt; Tenant Outbound External Recipients Rate</i>. This report shows the current volume of external recipients, your tenant’s daily quota, how much of the quota is used, and the number of recipients that were blocked if the limit was exceeded. The report will also show if enforcement for the limit is enabled or disabled. For example, for tenants who have more than 500 email licenses it will show “Disabled” until May 1st, the day we’ll start to enable enforcement for tenants who have more than 500 licenses.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This change will roll out in progressive stages over the month of March as per the following rollout schedule:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Phase</td><td>Enable enforcement for tenant group</td><td>Rollout start date</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Tenants with &lt;= 25 email licenses</td><td>April 3, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 200 licenses</td><td>April 18, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 500 licenses</td><td>April 28, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+ all remaining tenants</td><td>May 9, 2025</td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your tenant exceeds its daily outbound sending limit further messages sent to external recipients will be blocked and senders will receive one of the following bounce messages (also known as Non-Delivery Receipts or NDRs):\n</p><ul><li>Trial tenants: 550 5.7.232 - Your message can't be sent because your trial tenant has exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li><li>Non-trial tenants: 550 5.7.233 - Your message can't be sent because your tenant exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Check the report in the EAC to see your tenant’s quota and current daily outbound email volume and whether or not any messages will be blocked once the TERRL is enabled for your tenant. If your current outbound email volume is well below the quota, you don’t have to do anything. If your outbound email volume is near or exceeding your quota, consider using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services email</a> for high-volume email to external recipients instead. ACS email which offers significant advantages and features for high-volume email, especially for external recipients. Messages sent using ACS email are not counted against your Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit quota.\n</p><p>For more information about the Tenant External Recipient Rate feature and report please see this blog post:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-exchange-online-tenant-outbound-email-limits/4372797\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing Exchange Online Tenant Outbound Email Limits</a></li></ul>",

We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

With hotpatch updates, you can quickly take measures to help protect your organization from cyberattacks, while minimizing user disruptions. You’ll first create a hotpatch-enabled quality update policy in Windows Autopatch through the Microsoft Intune console. Eligible devices managed by this policy will be offered hotpatch updates in a quarterly cycle.

Devices receive the same level of security patching as the monthly standard security updates released on the second Tuesday of every month. Users can continue their work without interruptions while hotpatch updates are installed. Hotpatch updates don’t require the PC to restart for the remainder of the quarter. (Note: OS features, firmware, and/or application updates may still cause a restart in the quarter.)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Check if your devices are eligible for hotpatch updates by reading Additional information.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out in late September 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by mid-October 2025 (previously mid-June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Between July 1st and August 1st, 2025, we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After August 1st 2025, all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.\n</p><p>DNS resolution will safely fallback to “plain” DNS if a domain is not DNSSEC enabled. If an Accepted Domain you add to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after July 1st is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by July 1st to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After July 1st, List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after July 1st.\n</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st, mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

With real time user collaboration, different users can collaborate on the same file at the same time. Version history allows users to see when and who made changes to a file and provides the ability to restore to a previous version of the file within the Office app. If there are conflicts within a file that does not require user input, Office will merge the conflicts and ensure that the Office file is up to date with the latest changes. If user input is required to merge conflicts, Office will show the merge conflicts and prompt the user to choose which edits to prioritize.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change, especially if the policy is disabled, educate them about autosave, real time user collab, and merging in the case of M365 application conflicts, and update any relevant documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy#allow-users-to-choose-how-to-handle-office-file-sync-conflicts\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Allow users to choose how to handle Office file sync conflicts</a>.</p>",

Thank you for your patience</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/bookings/bookings-overview?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Bookings</a> is an online scheduling tool (included in your Microsoft 365 subscription) that enables businesses to manage their appointments seamlessly. Bookings allows users to create customizable booking pages where customers, clients, or colleagues can easily schedule time with them or their team without the usual back-and-forth communication.\n</p><p>Coming soon: We will launch Queue as a new functionality in Bookings. Queue will be available in Bookings for users with a Microsoft Teams Premium license.\n</p><p>Queue is a powerful feature that provides real-time visibility and control over incoming appointments. Queue provides schedulers and admins with a consolidated view of each day's appointments in chronological order for the booking pages they manage, so they can better manage the load of incoming appointments and reassign delayed appointments to available staff. Staff can also self-serve on busy days by assigning the unassigned appointments to themselves, helping to balance workloads across teams or specific services. Users can send SMS and email reminders from the queue view and keep customers informed, helping to enhance overall transparency and ensure a smooth appointment experience for everyone involved.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=470136\" target=\"_blank\">470136</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The Queue functionality in Bookings will be available by default for Teams Premium users.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ae721b4e-4cb7-4aae-83d9-535529c23898\" target=\"_blank\">Watch a short view about Queue</a> (00:09 min)\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> Microsoft Bookings users without Teams Premium license will have access to the Queue tab with this banner: \"This feature requires a Teams Premium license.

This migration aims to improve data consistency and reliability, particularly in investigation and threat-hunting experiences.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out this migration early November 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>Key benefits</i></p><ul><li><i>Ensures data consistency across multiple user experiences: </i>By consolidating data management under a unified platform, this migration will eliminate discrepancies between different workflows, ensuring that security analysts have access to consistent and reliable data across various investigation and hunting experiences.\n</li><li><i>Establishes data parity between Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting: </i>By leveraging a single, unified data source, the migration will ensure that data retrieved in Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting remains synchronized. This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered.

This process may be required for security or privacy, such as after a data spillage incident or for compliance and regulatory requirements.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392838\" target=\"_blank\">392838</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late February 2025 (previously early February) and expect to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously mid-February).</p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out late September 2025 (previously late March) and expect to complete by mid-October 2025 (previously mid-April).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Priority Cleanup administrators can now set up a Priority Cleanup policy for Exchange to create exceptions to retention principles and e-Discovery holds for specific scenarios. Once administrators are within the Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) Solution on Microsoft Purview, they can visit the Priority Cleanup tab and follow the wizard to set-up this policy. Like auto-apply retention labels, Priority Cleanup supports policy simulation mode, so administrators can check the returned samples in case the policy configuration needs any fine-tuning before enabling the policy. Once set-up, because the deletion by a priority cleanup policy is irreversible and can override existing holds, the process requires multiple approvals, specific roles, and is audited. Thus, respective reviewers must be mandatorily added during policy creation to allow for disposition of items under a retention or e-Discovery hold.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Because of the built-in safeguards, the feature itself is enabled by default at the tenant level. However, Priority Cleanup can be turned off on the Priority Cleanup settings page. If you can't create new Priority Cleanup policies, refer to  your Data Lifecycle Management documentation for necessary roles and permissions requirements. A new role permission \"Priority cleanup administrator\" is now added to Purview role permissions to enable data governance administrators to use this feature.</p>",

Please see the FAQ for more information.\n</li><li>Work or school search history on Bing.com will be available through March 31, 2025. Individuals who wish to keep their recent search history must download it by March 31 by signing in with their Entra ID, going to Options on Bing.com, and selecting “Search history.” There is no control available for IT admins to download search terms on behalf of users.\n</li><li>To help users on Bing.com, a banner to redirect to M365.cloud.microsoft will be shown in Edge if search terms are high likelihood of being work-related.

The last day of its availability is on March 31, 2025. This change is being made as we streamline search experiences and focus on enhancing core productivity tools.\n</p><p>The Microsoft Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box will continue to support work and school search, with some adjustments detailed below. \n</p><p>Details of the Change\n</p><p>After March 31, 2025, Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer be available, with changes as follows:\n</p><ul><li>Bing.com will no longer show work or school search results. Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com. However, selecting the Work or School tab on Bing.com will redirect users to the new Microsoft Search experience on M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com).\n</li><li>Search boxes you’ve configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work or school results.\n</li><li>The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will continue to support work and school search with some adjustments, including:\n<ul><li>The Edge for Business address bar will no longer return work or school search results on a Bing.com page but will continue to provide suggested results in the address bar. In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible. With these changes, users will see some UX changes in the Windows search box.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>As before, the core Microsoft Search experience remains accessible through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.\n</p><ul><li>Additionally, Entra ID sign-in will no longer be available on Bing.com, since work and school search is no longer available on Bing.com.\n</li></ul><p>An FAQ and further details are now available at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Guidance for retiring Microsoft Search in Bing for your organization</a>, which will be updated regularly.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>The last day of availability of Microsoft Search in Bing is March 31, 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>For organizations using Microsoft Search in Bing, users will need to transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. \n</p><p>Users who are accustomed to using the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box can continue to conduct work searches through these endpoints entry points, with the expectation that there will be some adjustment in these experiences after the deprecation date. (For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new license request feature and self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot will be widely available for all tenants. End user license request and self-service purchase will now be available for users with Microsoft 365 E1, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E1, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, Microsoft 365 Apps for Business and standalone products.  Both License request and self-service purchase will be shown within Microsoft 365 apps such as Copilot Chat, the unpaid version of work chat included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.  \n</p><p>\n</p><p>License Request allows users to request a Microsoft 365 Copilot license directly from their admin. This helps you efficiently assign unused licenses or purchase additional ones and assign based on user request. Global admins, license admins, and user admins will be able to manage these requests seamlessly in the Microsoft 365 admin center and can choose between standard or custom messaging, including directing to a third-party URL.</p><p>Self-Service Purchase allows users to purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses directly with their own credit card and use within their tenant with their Microsoft admin’s visibility and control. <b>Note: </b>If your organization has previously disabled self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot, your existing settings will be honored.</p><p>This message is related to MC853238 (Updated) Microsoft 365 admin center: New self-service purchase and trial settings (published August 2024, updated September 2024).

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late May 2025 (previously late April). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase. Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously late June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment. IT, network, or security admins inside your organization may be able to help identify instances and plan changes. Check your configuration for desktop and mobile browsers because they may be different.</li></ul><p>Email Domain</p><ul><li><i>The sender domain used in emails from Viva Engage will start changing from @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft.</i> This phased change to emails will continue until all Viva Engage email notifications and digests use the new sender domain. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

We've added a new setting that allows admins to disable this trial access using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint Online Management Shell</a>. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/microsoft-365/in-app-trials-terms-of-service\" target=\"_blank\">View the Trial Agreement details</a>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The promotion will go into effect January 6, 2025, and remain active until June 30, 2025. At the beginning of December 2024, admins can disable trial access at any point during the promotional period, via the SharePoint Online Management Shell. Tenants that are eligible for the promotion will see a message bar on the Copilot Admin page in the Admin Center. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/309f50a9-899a-427a-b363-9a9da9b8c306\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to prepare:</b></p><p>Starting the beginning of December, Global administrators or SharePoint admins can use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell\" target=\"_blank\">SharePoint Online Management Shell</a> to manage access to the trial for users without Copilot licenses.</p><p>This can be done by updating to the latest version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell and running the following commands: \n</p><ul><li>To opt out and disable access to the trial use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spocopilotpromooptinstatus?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Set-SPOCopilotPromoOptInStatus</a> cmdlet. \n</li><li>To confirm trial settings, use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spocopilotpromooptinstatus?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Get-SPOCopilotPromoOptInStatus</a>  cmdlet. \n</li><li>To re-enable access to the trial, use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spocopilotpromooptinstatus?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Set-SPOCopilotPromoOptInStatus</a> cmdlet. \n</li></ul><p>Ensure that you have the latest version of SharePoint PowerShell installed to run these cmdlets effectively. \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Once the trial promotion is available, your unlicensed users will be able to view and interact directly with agents in SharePoint.

Once the maximum number of queries is reached, users will be notified that the service is temporarily unavailable and prompted to try again next month.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/c0088e26-95f9-47ed-923b-9134ca8f47f4\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><br></p><p>\n</p><p>Unused queries will not roll over to the following month. If you need more queries, you can get them by adding additional Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.  After the trial ends on June 30, 2025, users without an M365 Copilot License will no longer be able to create or use the agents. However, agents created and used during the trial promotion will remain available, and no historical data will be lost.\n</p><p>Additional information:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/agentsinsharepointpromo\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the agents in SharePoint promotion</a></li><li>Learn more about <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/copilot-in-sharepoint-help-learning-44e981e7-dcef-4422-977d-967f3dcfe796?ocid=CopilotLab_SMC_SharePoint\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot in SharePoint</a> \n</li></ul>",

An E3/E5 license is required to use this feature.\n</p><p>After this change, pending or inactive users will no longer receive community conversations or emails unless they accept the invitation and complete the registration process. This change prioritizes active engagement, ensuring only registered users access conversation updates and reducing the volume of emails sent to non-registered users. External users who have activated their accounts will receive conversations and community emails.\n</p><p>We will begin rolling out this change early December 2024 and expected to complete by early January 2025.

After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3.

Currently, when you make metadata changes such as title, description, transcripts, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, media settings, etc. to files in Microsoft Stream, each of those changes cause new versions to be created. Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning. Any changes made specifically to chapters and transcripts of files from Stream will stop making versions, thus preventing storage from increasing as rapidly as it has in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395380\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">395380</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late August 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Changes to video and audio files from Stream will no longer take version snapshots.

If you are currently following this guidance, <i>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</i></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences. You can refer them to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-cloud-microsoft-7ba4c8b9-d062-4444-84a5-fca6c3006d2b\" target=\"_blank\">What is cloud.microsoft? - Microsoft Support</a> for more information.\n</li><li>If your organizational websites, tools, or other materials reference the old URL, those links will be automatically redirected. However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

The first version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise without Office Telemetry Dashboard will be Version 2208, which is expected to be available first in Current Channel in the second half of August 2022.  \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you do not use Office Telemetry Dashboard, you can disregard this message.  \n</p><p>Components of the Office Telemetry Dashboard will no longer be available in Version 2208 or later including the Office Telemetry Agent, Office Telemetry Processor, and the dashboard itself.  \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Office Telemetry Log is not being removed and will still be available on client devices running Windows.</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b><br></p><p>The first version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise without Office Telemetry Dashboard will be Version 2208. That version is expected to be available first in Current Channel in the second half of August 2022. \n</p><p>Version 2208 is expected to be available in Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel in January 2023. \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Office Telemetry Dashboard is not being removed from existing perpetual versions of Office, such as Office Professional Plus 2019. If you are using a perpetual version of Office, Office Telemetry Dashboard will be supported as long as your version of Office is supported. Here are the end of support dates for perpetual versions of Office that include the Office Telemetry Dashboard: \n</p><ul><li>Microsoft Office 2013 – April 11, 2023 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2016 – October 14, 2025 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2019 – October 14, 2025 \n</li></ul><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b> </p><p>Once a device in your organization updates to Version 2208 or later of Microsoft 365 Apps, Office Telemetry Dashboard components will be either removed or become unsupported.</p><p>To access information about the COM and VSTO add-ins in your environment, you can use the inventory feature available in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center \n</p><p> <b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>As the devices update to Version 2208 or later, the Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Agent will be automatically uninstalled from the devices.</p><p>However, the Office Telemetry Processor will need to be manually removed from devices using your standard management tools as there will be no new data for it to process. Similarly, the rest of the infrastructure including the shared folder and the SQL Server for permanent storage of telemetry data will become obsolete and therefore can be removed.  \n</p>",
