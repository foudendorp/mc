These self-service trial licenses will be a part of your Microsoft organizational tenant, and you will be able to manage these licenses like other Microsoft subscriptions. You will be able to cancel these trial licenses at any time.</p><p>You will also be able to fully control whether trials are converted to paid subscriptions. Users will not need to input payment information when signing up. If a user would like to convert to a paid license, they must work with you directly to do so as there is no auto-renew functionality for these trials. If a user isn’t upgraded to a paid subscription, all services included in their Microsoft Teams Premium will end, and the user may lose read only access to data generated by Teams Premium, stored in Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.<br></p><p>Users in tenants where self-service trials are disabled may still see the “Get Premium” prompt when accessing features that require a premium license. This is expected behavior and helps signal user interest to admins. It can also help identify which users in your organization may need a Teams Premium license, allowing you to better manage and allocate your available licenses.&nbsp; To reduce confusion and prevent users from submitting license requests, admins can customize the license request flow. Instead of showing the default request form, they can configure a custom message explaining that license requests are not supported in their organization.

We previously stated that this is a new feature when it is an expanded capability of the existing feature memory in Copilot.

Thank you to the customers who provided feedback over the past few weeks. We have adjusted our roadmap to address your needs and concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting September 1, 2025, Microsoft 365 Copilot will start remembering key highlights from your person-to-person communications in chats, emails, and meetings.

Admins can enable this feature using the following steps:<ol><li><b>Register a Microsoft Entra application</b>: A Power Platform Administrator creates an Entra app to securely authenticate between Copilot Studio and the chosen external monitoring provider. This can be done using a provided PowerShell script or manually through the Azure portal.</li><li><b>Configure integration in Power Platform Admin Center</b>: The administrator enters the Entra app details and the REST API endpoint from the security partner in the Admin Center’s threat detection settings.</li></ol>Once enabled, Copilot Studio shares only the necessary runtime data with the external provider for real-time decision-making. The integration can be disabled at any time if requirements change. External threat detection is available only for generative agents using generative orchestration (not classic agents).<br><br>Organizations are responsible for ensuring their chosen provider’s data handling and compliance standards meet internal and regulatory requirements.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>If you would like more information on this feature, please visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO12592\">Enable external threat detection and protection for Copilot Studio custom agents (preview)</a>.",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out late June 2026 (previously early February 2026) and expect to complete by late June 2026 (previously early February 2026).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;   \n<b>What it is</b></p><p>Microsoft is rolling out a new feature to streamline how app and agent availability is managed across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Until now, IT admins configured availability settings separately in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC) and the Teams Admin Center (TAC), which led to mismatches. With this update, you’ll be able to unify availability policies for apps and agents across both portals, making app management more consistent and efficient<b>.</b></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">393931</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\" target=\"_blank\">503105</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:\n</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature late September 2025 and expect to complete by end of June 2026 (previously mid-November 2025).</p><p>1. <b>Phase 1 – Default Tenant Unification</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this feature at the end of September 2025. This initial phase targets tenants that have never modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock in either the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Teams admin center.  At the end of this phase, agent and app manageability will be unified across both Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center ensuring agent and Microsoft 365 <b>apps availability</b> policies are in alignment for all future administrative changes.

This phase targets tenants that have previously modified their organization-wide defaults, app availability, or block/unblock settings in either admin center. These tenants will be transitioned to a unified management experience across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.</p><ul><li><b>For tenants with agent or app availability differences across both admin centers</b>, a <b>wizard</b> in the Teams admin center will help identify affected agents and apps and guide through resolving discrepancies.</li><li><b>For tenants with no agent or app availability differences across both admin centers, </b>guidance&nbsp;will be provided to transition to&nbsp;unified availability policy. </li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=503105\" target=\"_blank\">503105</a>.</p><p>3.\t<b>Phase 3 – Automatic Unification\n</b></p><p>Tenants that haven’t transitioned as part of Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2, will be automatically moved to unified app agent management. We will update this post with a timeline and more details later.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified agent app management, you will be able to manage apps on the Integrated apps page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.</p><div>What you can expect:\n</div><ul><li>You’ll gain a consolidated view of agent and Microsoft 365 app availability across both Microsoft 365 and Teams admin centers.\n</li><li>Changes made in either admin center to the agent and app availability will automatically apply across all supported hosts.\n</li><li>Organization-wide defaults for both admin centers will be in sync and govern app availability across Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 copilot app.</li></ul><p><b>&nbsp;What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, review your tenant-level and individual agent/app settings (app allow/block &amp; user availability) in both the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and the Teams Admin Center. If different departments within your organization manage these settings, we suggest coordinating efforts to complete the review collaboratively.\n</p><p>This update will be rolled out automatically by the stated date, and no immediate action is required. However, it's a good time to update any internal documentation related to agent and app management policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/uam-tac-mac\" target=\"_blank\">Unified agent and app availability management across Microsoft 365 and Teams Admin Centers - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p>",

If you wish to have agent auto creation turned on, you may do so in \"Agent Settings\" in the Teams Admin Center.<br><br>An agent for every channel: Teams channels provide an organized space for teams to manage workstreams and communicate with stakeholders. Now, each channel can have a dedicated agent that draws on its conversations and meetings to act as a domain expert for the team. These agents adopt the channel’s name and help with common tasks – for example, flagging important deadlines that are buried in conversations, summarizing progress with succinct status reports, assigning tasks and due dates, and answering questions asked in natural language like “What’s the latest on our budget?” You can even invite these agents into meetings when you need expert insights in the discussion.</p><ul><li>Status reporting: The agent can draft a status report for your project on your behalf. It pulls updates from channel conversations, meeting summaries, Planner boards, and announcements, organizing them into sections within the report. You can edit the draft directly in Teams before publishing it to the channel</li><li>Providing answers: Instead of manually searching for information across posts and threads, simply ask the agent. It checks the channel’s conversations, meetings, and plans, and can also trigger a web search. Then it quickly compiles the insights, summarizes the information, and delivers a clear, actionable reply</li><li>Planner integration: When a user assigns a task to another user via your channel’s agent, it creates a plan in Planner. Users can then ask the agent questions about the plan and the agent will keep them updated on the status of action items</li></ul><p><i>Image 1 - Add an agent to a Teams channel:</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/b37eb87a-ae47-4abe-9154-fc43cc71afa5/0dfa6d004503fcc979d6357a0d048c342c77ad08.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p><i>Image 2 - Channel Agent participates in the conversation:</i></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/static/public/messagecenter/neutral/74cb68c0-fa7e-45c1-be0b-8dee58e92eda/6ae144c0efe5c493db21344abb1225ad3d120d55.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\"></p><p></p><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Channel Agent may gather and share context that crosses information barriers.</li><li>Channel Agent is best supported by English (US).</li><li>Channel Agent is not supported in private channels.</li><li>Channel Agent is not functional in channels that contain external or guest users.</li><li>Channel Agent is not supported in tenants that use Customer Key.</li><li>Processing data from previews can happen outside of the EU Data Boundaries</li></ul>\n\n<p></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><ul><li><b>Public Preview</b>: We will begin rolling out in <b>mid-September 2025</b> and expect to complete by <b>mid-October 2025</b>.</li></ul><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>This new agent is available in public preview and customers are required to have the following licenses to access in public preview.

To add an agent to a channel, open the side panel through the “Agents and Bots” button in the upper right-hand corner of the channel. Once the side panel is open, you will see a banner to add an agent to this channel.</p><p>An agent will be automatically added to newly created channels.

This change is part of Microsoft’s ongoing security improvements and will affect how Outlook add-ins identify and process inline images using the attachment ID.

As a result, your current parsing logic won’t be able to correlate the inline image in the mail body with the attachment ID or Base64 value of the image.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>What will happen:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images will be represented by a content ID (cid) in the src attribute.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Add-ins that extract the attachment ID from the image URL will no longer be able to correlate images reliably.</li>\n<li>With this change, add-ins must:\n  <ul>\n\n<li>Parse the HTML message body and retrieve the <code>cid</code> value from the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>\n    <li>Use <code>Office.context.mailbox.item.getAttachmentsAsync</code> to retrieve an <code>AttachmentDetailsCompose</code> object.</li><li>To restore correlation, match the <code>contentId</code> property from the object to the <code>cid</code> value in the HTML.</li><li>To retrieve base64 value of the image attachment, use <code>office.context.mailbox.item.getAttachmentContentAsync</code>.&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Example AttachmentDetailsCompose object:</b></p>\n<pre><code>[\n{\n  \"id\": \"AAkALgAAAAAAHYQDEapmEc2byACqAC/EWg0AW4xUByFbp0CroCNphMYEEAADMWhyywAAARIAEADghOrwhp8zR7umVQRBkN51\",\n  \"name\": \"image.png\",\n  \"contentType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"size\": 2371,\n  \"attachmentType\": \"file\",\n  \"isInline\": true,\n  \"contentId\": \"7957e11a-ce80-438b-87cd-611b3d6a3ec4\"\n}\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p><b><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update your add-in’s parsing logic to retrieve the <code>cid</code> value from the <code>src</code> attribute of inline images.</li>\n<li>Use <code>getAttachmentsAsync</code> to match the content ID with the image.</li>\n<li>Ensure your add-in supports both the previous and updated implementations during the rollout.</li>\n<li>Test your add-in to confirm it correctly identifies and processes inline images using the new method.</li><li>Update internal developer documentation if it references the previous method of parsing inline image URLs.</li><li>Communicate this change to helpdesk or support teams if they assist with Outlook add-in troubleshooting.</li>\n<li>Review the sample code provided in the <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Developer Blog: Changes to inline images in Outlook</a>.</li><li>Leave a comment on this post or in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Developer Blog: Changes to inline images in Outlook</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions.</li>\n<li>Watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z-vYEb4N2go\" target=\"_blank\">October 2025 Office Add-ins Community Call </a>(YouTube link)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b><b>Compliance considerations:</b></b></p><p>Placing the content ID in the src attribute matches how classic Outlook on Windows represents inline images.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Inline image retrieval now uses secure headers instead of tokenized URLs, changing how image data is accessed.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change modify how users can access, export, delete, or correct their personal data within Microsoft 365 services?</td><td>The method for accessing inline image data in emails is updated, which may affect how add-ins handle personal data.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><p></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Copilot can help users engage with their content in a new and dynamic way—through audio. This new feature will enable Copilot to turn documents, meetings, and files into an audio overview, creating a listening experience that’s easy to follow. Users can ask Copilot to generate an audio overview in the Copilot chat pane, and Copilot will bring the content to life through a podcast-style discussion between two hosts who offer insightful commentary, draw connections between topics, and even exchange lively banter about the key points of their content. Soon, Copilot will also allow users to choose how they want to listen: select one or two speakers, adjust the style from concise to playful, and tailor the length to short, medium, or long. This capability is integrated directly into the tools users are familiar with—OneDrive, Teams, Word, and Copilot Notebooks—so it’s ready whenever and wherever they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap IDs:&nbsp;<font color=\"#000000\" style=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=487423\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">487423</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=478649\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">478649</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=485747\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">485747</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=487854\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">487854</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=490051\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">490051</a></font></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide):</p><ul><li>This capability will begin rolling out in Copilot Notebooks on web for English only in May 2025&nbsp;</li><li>This capability will begin rolling out for Copilot in OneDrive on web for English only in May 2025</li><li><b>This capability will begin rolling out for Copilot in Teams on desktop and mobile for English only in October 2025&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></li><li>The podcast-style overview will begin rolling out for Copilot in Word on web and Windows desktop in May for English only.

This feature reached general availability on October 3, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me? </b><br>\nYou can improve the quality of your unified customer profiles and insights by filtering out unwanted rows from your source data directly. You don't need to filter out unwanted data in downstream processes, and you can apply row filters directly to any source table you ingest, reducing the data scope to just what you need. <br><br>\nKey benefits include:<ul>\n<li><b>Improved processing time: </b>Filtering out unnecessary data like old or obsolete rows can reduce the time required to process the data. Filtering out a significant percentage of unwanted rows can substantially improve performance. </li>\n<li><b>Simplified data configuration: </b>Removing unwanted data at the source eliminates the need to create rules in multiple locations to avoid incorporating the unwanted data. Unification, segments, measures, activities, and predictive insights will use the filtered source data. </li>\n<li><b>Improved data quality: </b>Removing old or obsolete data at the source prevents it from being accidentally included in your results, such as when a new team member creates a segment that includes obsolete data. </li>\n </ul>\n<b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/12084/filter-rows-columns-source-data-improved-processing\" target=\"_blank\">Filter rows from source data for better processing</a>.",

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:&nbsp;</b>Updated Rollout Schedule for iPhone and iPad</p><p>The first phase of this change is in-product notifications in the M365 Copilot app to encourage users who are editing documents to install the Word, PowerPoint, Excel apps. Users who try to browse files or manage their OneDrive libraries will be promoted to install the OneDrive app. This in-app notification will roll out to TestFlight users at the end of August and become generally available the week of September 15, 2025. This is a modification from the initial post to allow our enterprise customers more time to prepare.</p><p>The second phase of this change updates the Word, PowerPoint and Excel functionality in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with previewers that will be made available to TestFlight users only in October and GA rollout will begin mid-October 2025. This will be a gradual, phased rollout that will take about 4 weeks or so to reach 100% of customers. These changes only apply to iPhone for now, iPad will see similar changes with a start of TestFlight in early November, and the start of the GA rollout in mid November. For iPad we will have a phased rollout that gradually ramps up to 100% of GA in about 4 weeks time.</p><p>To get early builds and test out features before GA dates – you will need to join the iOS TestFlight program for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app.  There are a limited number of seats available in the iOS TestFlight program. We periodically remove inactive users (those who have not updated their build) to make space for others. If you are unable to join because the program is full, please check back later, or contact your Microsoft Support representative.

Users will continue to be able to view files and use Copilot Chat to get deeper analysis and insights on their content. If a user needs to edit, the M365 Copilot app will transition to the standalone Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps. Users of the M365 Copilot app will continue to be able to browse and search recent files in the app, but users seeking comprehensive file management features will be encouraged to utilize the OneDrive app. When users land in the M365 Copilot app Search experience and navigate to the My files, Libraries, or My device entry points a notification will appear promoting the use of the OneDrive app for these actions.\n</p><p>Detailed Change Log: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, M365 Copilot App \n</p><ul><li>Word, Excel, PowerPoint: The Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iPhone and iPad will a provide a Copilot powered preview experience for documents.

For advanced file management, users will be directed to the standalone OneDrive app. \n</li><li>Create Experience: Document creation in the M365 Copilot app will be available from chat. After file creation, users can view the file within M365 Copilot. Editing the document will transition to the standalone WXP apps. \n</li><li>Offline File Experience: For users who wish to make files available offline, please use the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneDrive apps. \"Make Available Offline\" is being removed from the M365 Copilot app in favor of Copilot powered previewer experiences.\n</li><li>PDF Workflows: No changes.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamssupport/moving-teams-android-devices-to-aosp-device-management/4140893\" target=\"_blank\">Moving Teams Android Devices to AOSP Device Management | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>\n\n \n<table><tbody>\n\n<tr><th>OEM</th>\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th>Models</th>\n<th>Targeted Release</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AudioCodes</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>C470HD</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td><td>Phones</td>\n<td>C430HD\n<br>C435HD\n<br>C455HD<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RXV81<br>RXV200<br>RXPad<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Audiocodes</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>RX Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TSS-770<br>TSS-1070<br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Crestron AIO Video Bar 70 \n<br>Crestron Touch Panel TS-1070<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Cisco Room Bar\n<br>Cisco Room Bar Pro \n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQ \n<br>Cisco Room Kit Pro\n<br>Cisco Desk Pro\n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQX \n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 55\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 55 \n<br>Cisco Navigator<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Cisco Navigator Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>DTEN</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>DTEN D7X 75\"\n<br>DTEN D7X 55\" \n<br>DTEN Bar\n<br>DTEN Mate TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Jabra</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Jabra Panacast 50 VBS\n<br>Jabra Panacast 50 TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RallyBar <b>VR0019</b>\n<br>RallyBar mini <b>VR0020</b>\n<br>TAP IP <b>VR0029</b>\n<br>TAP\n<br>RoomMate <b>VR0030</b>\n<br>Logi Rallybar Huddle (VR0034]<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Tap Scheduler  <b>VR0028</b>\n<br>DockFlex <b>VR0035</b><br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar <b>NF19B1</b> \n<br>Neat Board <b>NF19C1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Pro <b>NF21D1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Gen2 <b>NF22E1</b>\n<br>Neat Board 50 <b>NF22H1</b>\n<br>Neat Board Pro 65  <b>NF23K1</b><br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Displays</td><td>Neat Frame <b>NF21F1</b></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>CCX350 \n<br>CCX400\n<br>CCX500\n<br>CCX505\n<br>CCX600\n<br>TrioC60<br></td>\n<td>March 25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Poly Studio X30\n<br>Poly Studio X50\n<br>Poly Studio X52\n<br>Poly Studio X70\n<br>Poly Studio X72\n<br>Poly Studio G7500\n<br>Poly Studio G62\n<br>Poly TC8\n<br>Poly TC10<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TC10 - Panel</td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X</b></td>\n<td>MP54\n<br>MP56\n<br>MP58\n<br>CP965<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X E2</b></td>\n<td>MP52E2\n<br>MP54E2\n<br>MP56E2 \n<br>MP58E2<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A10\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A20\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A30\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A40\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 65\"\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 86\"\n<br>Yealink Deskvision A24\n<br>Yealink CTP18 \n<br>Yealink CTP25<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A40</td>\n<td><br>March 2025</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel\n<br>RoomPanel Plus<br></td>\n<td><br>Available</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel E2\n<br>RoomPanel Plus E2<br></td>\n<td><br>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</tbody></table>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated October 7, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) will be adding a new role--Data Security Investigation Contributor--to the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group. This will allow members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group to launch   a Data Security Investigation (DSI) from an IRM case.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. DSI visualizes correlations between investigation data, users, and their activities. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams. Post-investigation learnings can be used to refine existing policies to strengthen an organization's security practices.  \n</p><p>The integration between IRM and DSI allows an IRM investigator to identify when a risky user needs deeper investigation to launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from the user activity pane, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with roadmap ID  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=485707\" target=\"_blank\">485707</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in mid-October 2025 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>With this update, members of the Insider Risk Management Investigators role group will be able to create Data Security Investigations from an Insider Risk Management case.

Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We’re making some changes to DNS provisioning of A records for all new Accepted Domains provisioned after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st). Between early and late February 2026 (previously early October and late October), we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st) to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st).</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after February 1st, 2025 (previously October 1st), mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.  This feature will be available starting in March 2025, at which point, users signed into accounts with external Copilot licenses will be able to use Copilot on their work and school documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote desktop and mobile apps.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b> \n</p><p>If you wish to restrict multiple account access to Copilot, you can use the “Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents” <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a>.&nbsp; This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025</p><p><b>Additional information</b> \n</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2300619\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents</a>.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated September 18, 2025: We have updated the timing and content below with additional information. Thank you for your patience.</p>\n<p>In response to customer feedback, we are introducing enhanced flexibility, greater scalability, and streamlined compliance management for private channels in Microsoft Teams.\n</p><p>Note: It is important for compliance managers to review and take appropriate action before migration starts for these changes to private channels. \n</p><p><b>What's changing?</b></p><p>Private channels will transition use a channel mailbox instead of individual user mailboxes. \n</p><p>Organizations with compliance policies (retention, legal hold, data loss prevention, or eDiscovery) for private channels must review these policies and must apply policies to the Microsoft 365 group for the channel’s team before migration begins to ensure continuity of the policy for a private channel.  Existing policies will continue to apply to user mailboxes; post-migration, new data will be governed by policies on the group. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p>After the transition to updated private channels in your organization, private channels will be updated as follows.\n</p><ol><li>Private channels are no longer limited to 30 per team. Instead, private channels can be added up to the limit of 1000 total channels per team.\n</li><li>Private channels can now have up to 5000 members, instead of 250.\n</li><li>Meetings can now be scheduled in private channels.\n</li><li>Compliance policies for private channels are part of the team’s group policies instead of the individual user level.\n</li></ol><p>The migration of private channels to the updated capabilities will begin in early October 2025 and continue through December 2025. During this period, private channels will continue to operate normally. Admins and compliance managers should complete any required policy changes by September 20, 2025, before the migration begins. Migration can start or end at different times for each tenant during the rollout period. To track progress, a new PowerShell command will be available for tenants to check whether their migration has started or is completed. This post will be updated soon with details on the PowerShell command.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early October 2025 (prevously late September) and expect to complete by mid-December 2025.\n</p><p><b>Action required by compliance managers and admins</b></p><ol><li>Purview eDiscovery and Legal Hold</li>\n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel data will move from user mailboxes to the group mailbox, aligning with how shared channels data is stored. Previously, legal holds were applied to user mailboxes since private channel data resided in each member’s mailbox. Post-migration, the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is moved to the private channel’s group mailbox. Message edits and deleted messages will not be copied into the group mailbox.\n</p><p>Note: For users on hold, copies of message edits and deleted messages will remain in the user’s preserved library folder until the hold expires, while the latest version of private channel message data from each user’s mailbox is copied to the private channel’s group mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>If a legal hold exists for a private channel, admins must also apply the policy to the team’s group, in addition to the policy already applied to users’ mailboxes, in order for a hold to apply to new data generated and stored in the private channel’s mailbox. Note that policies applied to the team’s group can apply to all channels in the team.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/752d2d97-48d7-4491-a3e7-ecc866373a44  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 1: Setting up a new hold in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><p>After migration\n</p><p>For existing holds admins will need to ensure that the hold is applied to the user mailbox as well as the new group mailbox, in order for a hold to apply to existing and new message data. Any new legal holds will need to be applied to the group.\n</p><p>For complete eDiscovery, include both the private channel’s users’ mailboxes and the team’s group mailbox to retrieve pre-migration messages, message history, and post-migration new content.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/0de1f667-c352-400b-8a94-57237676a30d  \" width=\"400\" height=\"\"></p><p>Screenshot 2: Configuring an eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview compliance portal.\n</p><li>Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</li> \n<p></p><p>With this change, private channel messages will be included as a part of the DLP policy scoped to the private channel’s team’s group, as opposed to the user mailbox. \n</p><p>Before migration\n</p><p>Admins must modify the “Teams chat and channel messages” policy for private channels to add the team’s group containing the private channel, in addition to the user mailbox, in order to include new private channel messages in a policy.

Those manager capabilities will be phased out to provide a centralized place for managers to access insights.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=497111\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">497111</a></p><p><b>When will this happen</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early October 2025 (previously mid-September). and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late September).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization</b></p><p>The <a href=\"https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Viva Insights web app</a>&nbsp;will now serve as the single destination for manager insights, with new capabilities. \n</p><p>Key new capabilities in the web app include:\n</p><ul><li>Copilot Dashboard, tailored to the manager’s team, with pages for Adoption, Impact, and Learning.\n</li><li>Additional Copilot analytics reports, such as the Copilot for Sales adoption report, tailored to the manager’s team. \n</li><li>Analyst-published embedded reports, enabling managers to gain access to an extensive library of reports available within Advanced analysis, automatically tailored to their teams.\n</li><li>Delegation support, allowing managers to share their view with others in their organization.\n</li></ul><p>Managers using Organization insights in the Viva Insights Teams app will soon see a banner informing them of the new location to access these capabilities. Once these capabilities launch worldwide, managers will no longer be able to access Organization insights in the Teams app.</p><p><b>What do you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>No action is required by admins. Still, you might want to:</p><p>1. Prepare for default-on enablement of manager insights</p><ul><li>If you haven’t previously enabled manager insights, managers with 10 or more team members will receive access by default to Copilot insights when team views launch in late September. Admins can customize this threshold as needed (minimum allowed is 5) in the Manager settings tab of the Viva insights web app.</li><li>If your organization has already enabled manager insights and set a minimum team size threshold, those settings will continue to apply. Managers who meet the threshold and are enabled by admins will automatically gain access to the new capabilities in the Viva Insights web app.</li><li>If you wish to turn off this capability, admins can access Manager settings after this feature releases and set the \"Grant managers scoped access to Copilot insights\" toggle to off.</li></ul><p>Note: There are no changes in the license requirements needed to access team-scoped insights in the Viva insights web app. This means that managers will continue to require a Viva Insights or a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;2. Manage delegation controls</p><ul><li>If delegation is already in use by managers in your organization, existing delegates will automatically gain access to these new capabilities in the web app. Admins can manage delegation at the tenant or group level through the Microsoft 365 admin center.\n</li></ul><p>3. Turn on report publishing\n</p><ul><li>Admins can enable analysts to publish a broad set of Power BI reports from Advanced analysis directly to managers, giving them access to insights similar to those that exist in the Organizational behavior reports, and more! To do this, your organization must opt into the public preview for report publishing.\n</li></ul><p>4. Inform managers where to go\n</p><ul><li>A new, more powerful experience is coming. Let your managers know that these capabilities will soon be available in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Viva Insights web app</a>.</li></ul><p>To learn more, please see:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">Connect to the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard for Microsoft 365 customers | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/feature-access-management\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Viva Feature access management | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/manager-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Configure manager settings | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p><b>Compliance considerations</b></p><ul><li>Introduces or modifies AI/ML capabilities: Yes – Copilot chat insights in the Viva Insights Teams app will no longer be available. \n</li><li>Alters how existing customer data is accessed: Yes – reports tailored to manager’s teams provide new access pathways to existing data.\n</li><li>Includes admin controls: Yes – Admins can manage manager insights, delegation, and report publishing.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late May 2025 (previously late April). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase. Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously mid-August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

Starting with the September 2025 security update, WSUS running on Windows Server 2025 is removing dependencies on old code that’s no longer supported. This means that Windows operating systems (OS) that reached the end of their lifecycle will no longer qualify to receive extended security updates (ESU), unless you take additional action. Short-term and long-term next steps are available for Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 that still need to receive ESUs.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>When will this happen:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>September 9, 2025&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Removing certain binaries from WSUS helps ensure the integrity and security of our software supply chain.

This change helps protect your organization from unauthorized access and aligns with industry best practices for identity protection.\n</p><p>This effort is part of Microsoft’s commitment to enhance security for all customers and follows <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet#phase-1-applications\" target=\"_blank\">Azure’s Phase 1 rollout</a> completed last year. Phase 2 enforcement ensures that all Azure clients - including CLI, PowerShell, SDKs, and REST APIs - are protected against unauthorized access.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>Phase 2 enforcement will begin rolling out on  October 1, 2025, and will be applied gradually across tenants.

This enhancement allows data security admins to launch a pre-scoped DSI directly from an IRM case, enabling deeper investigation into risky user behavior and better post-incident impact assessment.</p><p>DSI is a new AI-powered solution that enables data security teams to identify incident-related data, conduct deep content analysis, and mitigate risk within one unified solution. DSI enables data security admins to efficiently identify incident-relevant content by searching their Microsoft 365 data estate to locate emails, Teams messages, Copilot prompts and responses, and documents. Once the investigation is scoped, DSI’s generative AI capabilities allow admins to gain deeper insights into the impacted data, revealing critical security risks and sensitive information. Investigative capabilities include the ability to categorize evidence, perform vector searches, and examine impacted data for security and sensitive data risks. To mitigate identified risks, DSI facilitates secure collaboration between partner teams.

This improvement supports better alignment with modern security practices and over time will make it easier for organizations using multiple Microsoft products to manage and maintain their firewall configurations. As a result, customers may be required to add these network (firewall) configurations in third-party applications to enable proper function of Intune device and app management. This change will affect customers using a firewall allowlist that allows outbound traffic based on IP addresses or Azure service tags.</p><p>Do not remove any existing network endpoints required for Microsoft Intune.

If your outbound traffic policy doesn’t include the new Azure Front Door IP address ranges, users may face login issues, devices might lose connectivity with Intune, and access to apps like the Intune Company Portal or those protected by app protection policies could be disrupted.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Ensure that your firewall rules are updated and added to your firewall’s allowlist with the additional IP addresses documented under Azure Front Door by <b>December 2, 2025</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you may add the service tag “AzureFrontDoor.MicrosoftSecurity” to your firewall rules to allow outbound traffic on port 443 for the addresses in the tag.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not the IT admin who can make this change, notify your networking team.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We hear your feedback about ways we can improve the notifications experience in Viva Engage. It's always a fine balance between ensuring your users are notified of relevant content without notifications feeling too overwhelming or noisy. In response to your feedback, we're rolling out an intelligent notifications experience. Specifically, this change will improve how <i>Community Announcement</i> notifications are delivered. This smarter delivery approach optimizes notifications delivery based on a user’s engagement behavior, helping to reduce notifications fatigue while ensuring timely visibility of announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen</b><b></b></p><p><b>General Availability (Worldwide): </b>We will begin rolling out this change in mid-September 2025 and expect to complete the rollout by early November 2025.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this affects your organization</b>\n</p><p>Previously, when an admin created a new Community Announcement, this would send a notification in Teams and Mobile Push immediately, followed by an email notification two hours later if the announcement was not opened already in Teams and/or Mobile Push.&nbsp;\nWith this new update:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Users will now receive the notification in <b>one channel only</b>—either Teams, Mobile Push, or Email. This notification channel may differ by user and is selected based on where a user has opened Engage notifications most frequently in the past 30 days.&nbsp;</li><li>If the announcement is not opened within two hours in the first notification channel, a <b>secondary notification channel</b> will be sent, also determined by where a user opens Engage notifications most frequently.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We will continue to respect all user notification preferences and settings where applicable. If a notification channel is disabled or the app is not installed, it will not be selected as a potential notification channel for the Community Announcement delivery.</p><p>Note that this change applies only to<b> regular Community Announcements in Viva Engage</b> and does not affect the \"immediate\" Community Announcement feature (where admins can still select the checkbox to send emails immediately —this functionality remains unchanged).</p><p><b>Can I still notify Community users via email immediately (along with other notification channels)?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! In Viva Engage, we offer an option to send an “immediate” Community Announcement. With this feature, Community admins can choose to send email notifications immediately after posting a Community Announcement, even if a user has opted out of receiving emails. All other notification channels will also send immediately along with email, including Teams and Mobile Push. Therefore, we recommend admins to use this feature when there is a Community Announcement that requires immediate attention from users.&nbsp;</p><p>Community Admins can find this “immediate” Community Announcement option by firstly navigating to the announcement publisher and selecting the hyperlinked <b><i>“option to send emails immediately” </i></b>at the bottom of the publisher. Upon clicking this option, an additional pop-up box will open called <i><b>“Immediate email delivery”</b></i>. By selecting this checkbox, this will ensure that all three notification channels – Email, Teams, and Mobile Push – will send to customers immediately after a Community Announcement is made.&nbsp;</p><p><b>\n&nbsp;What you can do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>No admin action is required. However, we recommend:\n</p><ul>\n<li>Informing your users about the new notifications change to reduce confusion</li>\n<li>Monitoring user feedback and engagement with <i>Community Announcements' notifications delivery</i></li>\n<li>Reviewing internal communication strategies to align with the new notification's behavior</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody><tr><th>Compliance Area</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change alter how existing customer data is processed, stored, or accessed?</td><td>Yes. Notification delivery logic now uses user behavior data (last 30 days of notification engagement) to determine delivery channels. This data is used to personalize delivery but is not stored permanently.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change introduce or significantly modify AI/ML or agent capabilities that interact with or provide access to customer data?</td><td>Yes. The system uses behavioral data to determine the most effective notification channel, which is a form of machine learning-based personalization.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Does the change provide a new way of communicating between users, tenants, or subscriptions?</td><td>Yes. The change modifies how users receive communications (Community Announcements) by introducing a dynamic, behavior-based delivery method.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>",

Please review the below.</p><p>We are implementing the following changes to custom scripting and classic publishing in SharePoint Online.</p><p><b>1. Disablement of custom scripting</b></p><p>Custom scripting will be disabled by default (setting DenyAddAndCustomizePages to 1 or $true) for sites created with the following templates:</p><ul><li>BLANKINTERNETCONTAINER#0 = Classic Publishing Portal Site\n</li><li>CMSPUBLISHING#0 = Classic Publishing Site\n</li><li>BLANKINTERNET#0 = Classic Publishing Site Blank</li><li>CSPCONTAINER#0 = SharePoint Embedded Site</li></ul><p>NOTE:\n</p><ul><li>Existing classic publishing sites created with the templates listed above will have custom scripting disabled by default. \n</li><li>Disabling custom scripting does not affect the execution of scripts that have already been added to a site or page.</li></ul><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> to learn more about the security considerations of ungoverned scripting.</p><p><b>2. Ability to set site property bag valued without requiring custom scripting enablement.</b></p><p>Users no longer need to set DenyAddAndCustomizePages to $false or 0 (i.e. enable custom scripting) in a site to manage site property bag values. We have introduced a new AllowWebPropertyBagUpdateWhenDenyAddAndCustomizePagesIsEnabled setting at the site level and at the tenant level to allow adding/managing site property bag values. Please see documentation here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">tenant level setting</a>&nbsp;and here for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps#-allowwebpropertybagupdatewhendenyaddandcustomizepagesisenabled\" target=\"_blank\">the site level setting.</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. Classic publishing sites creation and feature activation changes</b></p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new classic publishing related site collections or activate publishing features in existing site collections.

As part of these changes, servers which run Active Directory Certificate Services, as well as Windows domain controllers that service certificate-based authentication, will be required to meet certain certificate mapping criteria in order for authentication operations to succeed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final milestone of this rollout will take place with Windows updates released September 2025. For full details, see <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/help/5014754\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KB5014754: Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><b>When will this happen:</b></div><div>Beginning 2022, Windows updates have addressed certain vulnerabilities related to certificate emulation. As part of this, new certificate mapping requirements have been rolling out with various degrees of enforcement throughout 2023 and 2024. Windows updates released prior to September 2025 make it possible to further control the degree to which these requirements are enforced across environments. However, after the September updates, the ability to bypass requirements will end.</div><div><br></div><div><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></div><div>The specific vulnerability addressed in this scenario involves the use of dollar sign ($) at the end of a machine name. When present, methods could be used to emulate (spoof) certificates under some circumstances. Additionally,&nbsp;conflicts between User Principal Names (UPN) and&nbsp;sAMAccountName&nbsp;introduced other emulation vulnerabilities.</div><div><br></div><div>Updates released September 2025, will conclude the rollout of security hardening which prevents these vulnerabilities. From that time on, certain authentication operations will be denied if certificates cannot be strongly mapped per the security measures.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></div><div>We advise IT administrators to conduct testing that confirms normal operations in accordance with the new certificate mapping criteria. As always, we recommend that you update your devices to the latest security update available, to take advantage of the advanced protections from the latest security threats. Review the links provided in the Additional information section.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Additional information:</b></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/help/5014754\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KB5014754: Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers</a>.</li></ul>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated August 26, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are introducing improvements to how the Windows Autopatch Client Broker is managed and installed. The broker performs device readiness checks to identify whether a device is fully prepared to be managed by Windows Autopatch. Further, when a support request is created, it enables automated log collection to help diagnose and resolve issues more quickly. For information on data storage, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/overview/windows-autopatch-privacy\" target=\"_blank\"><u><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/overview/windows-autopatch-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy</a></u><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/overview/windows-autopatch-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></a>  \n</p><p>You will soon have the flexibility to deploy the client broker on-demand, either to all Autopatch devices or scoped to specific Entra ID groups. As part of this update, Win32 app deployment will become the default installation method, replacing the previous PowerShell-based approach. This change helps overcome limitations associated with PowerShell scripts and ensures a more reliable installation experience. Admins who prefer to use PowerShell can still manually install the broker using scripts if needed. \n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b>  \n</p><p>The changes will be gradually rolled out starting September 22, 2025.  \n</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization:</b>  \n</p><p>There will be no changes to your current set of devices with the client broker installed—they will remain assigned to the PowerShell script. However, with the upcoming launch, you’ll have the option to migrate to a Win32 app-based installation for improved reliability. Additionally, you’ll be able to use portal controls to selectively install the client broker on devices based on Entra ID groups. \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b> </p><p>You should prepare for these changes in the Microsoft Intune admin center and inform your team. If you have any questions or concerns, or need assistance, file a service request by visiting the <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Microsoft Intune admin center</u></a>.

It’s also removed from Windows Server 2025 starting with the September 2025 security update. Windows Insider preview builds already reflect this change as of July 2025. Windows PowerShell 2.0 is over 14 years old, lacks many security enhancements of the later versions, and has been deprecated since 2017. By using the newer and supported PowerShell 7 or PowerShell 5.1, you can help ensure that scripts run safer. If you have legacy scripts or software that explicitly depend on PowerShell 2.0, you’ll need to either update them or use a workaround to prevent disruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>When will this happen:</b>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>2017: PowerShell 2.0 was <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/windows-powershell-2-0-deprecation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">deprecated</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>July 2025: PowerShell 2.0 is removed from <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/07/03/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27891-canary-channel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Insider preview builds</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>August 2025 Windows non-security update: PowerShell 2.0 is removed from Windows 11, version 24H2 and later.&nbsp;</li><li>September 2025 Windows security update: PowerShell 2.0 is removed from Windows Server 2025 and later.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>This removal is part of a <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/windows-powershell-2-0-deprecation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">broader effort</a> to clean up legacy code, reduce the complexity of the PowerShell ecosystem, and improve Windows security. For most users and organizations, this change will be uneventful – newer versions of PowerShell (5.1 and 7.x) continue to be available and supported. However, if you have legacy scripts or software that explicitly depends on PowerShell 2.0, you will need to take action (update them or use a workaround) to prevent any disruptions.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Recommended: Migrate scripts and tools to newer PowerShell versions.

      "Content": "<p>Updated August 8, 2025: We have updated the timeline. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>We’re introducing Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (IRR) for Exchange Online, a new capability that helps organizations meet regional data residency requirements by allowing inbound email routing to be aligned with user locations. With IRR, admins can configure accepted domains to route messages directly to a designated geo-region, ensuring that email data is processed and stored entirely within the recipient’s region—even if it differs from the tenant’s primary location. This helps organizations meet compliance requirements without compromising email delivery performance.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=410245\" target=\"_blank\">410245</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in early October 2025 and expect to complete by end of October 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We expect to begin rolling out in early December 2025 and expect to complete by late December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>In-Region Routing (IRR) is disabled by default. If you do not plan to use this feature, no action is required.</p><p>For domains where you choose to enable IRR, the feature allows you to route inbound emails to accepted domains associated with specific geo-regions. When these domains are aligned with users located in the same geo-region, emails are fully processed and stored within the recipient’s region. This ensures that data remains within the user’s Preferred Data Location (PDL), supporting stronger data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.</p><p>If your organization uses Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), retention policies, or eDiscovery, you may need to review and adjust those policies to ensure they align with the new regional routing behavior.</p><p></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Ensure that admins have the necessary permissions to manage accepted domains and access to either Exchange Online PowerShell or to the Microsoft 365 admin center.</li><li>Review your domain configurations and identify users located in secondary geo-regions.\n</li><li>Prepare to configure accepted domains with the new geo-region property.</li><li>Review the licensing terms, as Multi-Geo licenses will be indefinitely required to use In-Region Routing:<ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#licensing\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#licensing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide#getting-started</a>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Review the documentation for configuring the feature: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/multi-geo-region-routing?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Configure Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (In Preview) - Microsoft 365 Enterprise | Microsoft Learn\"</a></li></ul><p>We value your feedback and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. Please comment or contact us through the M365 Admin Center if you need any assistance.</p><p><b>Compliance considerations:</b></p><ul><li>Does the change alter how existing user data is processed, stored, or accessed? - Yes. Emails are stored in-region based on domain configuration.</li><li>Does the change modify, interrupt, or disable any Purview capabilities? - Maybe. Depends on how DLP or retention policies are scoped by region.</li><li>Does the change alter how admins can monitor, report on, or demonstrate compliance activities? - Maybe. Regional routing may affect reporting granularity.</li></ul><p></p><p></p>",

It enhances usability and flexibility for hybrid work scenarios by offering:\n</p><ul><li>A unified desk booking interface across the calendar (New Outlook, Teams, OWA) and the Places app (web and connected app in Teams/Outlook)\n</li><li>Interactive floor maps with fixture support, including fallback functionality for floors without uploaded maps\n</li><li>The ability to view colleagues’ seating locations and reserve nearby desks (visibility is user-controlled)\n</li><li>Support for partial-day and multi-day desk reservations\n</li><li>Delegation capabilities for executive assistants or delegates to reserve desks on behalf of others</li><li>Admin-configurable check-in requirements, with automatic release of unclaimed desks\n</li><li>Support for both assigned desks (for specific users) and drop-in desks (non-reservable, real-time availability shown)\n</li></ul><p><b>Licensing: </b>This is a user experience update to an existing feature and requires a Teams Premium license.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance performance and scalability, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 investigation and hunting experiences are undergoing a data platform migration to establish a more robust, efficient, and scalable data storage system. This migration aims to improve data consistency and reliability, particularly in investigation and threat-hunting experiences.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out this migration and Phase 1 of performance improvement early November 2024 and was completed in late June 2025.</p><p>The rollout of Phase 2 of performance improvement is targeted for end December 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>Key benefits</i></p><ul><li><i>Ensures data consistency across multiple user experiences: </i>By consolidating data management under a unified platform, this migration will eliminate discrepancies between different workflows, ensuring that security analysts have access to consistent and reliable data across various investigation and hunting experiences.\n</li><li><i>Establishes data parity between Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting: </i>By leveraging a single, unified data source, the migration will ensure that data retrieved in Threat Explorer and Advanced Hunting remains synchronized. This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered. However, this will automatically resolve once the necessary data has been processed and stored.</li></ul><p><i>Resolution plan</i></p><p>While our team works on the migration, we are also actively working on optimizing the performance of the new data platform to align as closely as possible with the data freshness rate of Threat Explorer before the data platform migration. Also, efforts are underway to minimize failure rates across user experiences caused by temporary data unavailability.\n</p><p>The phase 1 performance improvement work was completed in late June 2025. After that, our teams are continuously monitoring the latencies and investing in further improvements to ensure seamless security operations experience to end users.</p><p>Phase 2 of the performance improvement plan is targeted to further improve the data freshness rate and is expected to complete by end of December 2025.</p><p>This change will be available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This migration will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",

These exempted senders will only be able to send emails exhibiting multiple From addresses without a Sender address header to recipients belonging to the same tenant as the sender. We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>We're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online, please review the section \"When this will happen\" for rollout timeline information for your tenant.</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address.

On October 15, we sent a targeted MC post to customers showing high volumes of messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address as they may be impacted by this change.\n</p><p>For investigating if you will be impacted by this change, focus your investigation on messages sent using On Premises Inbound Connectors to Exchange Online. Authenticated mail submission is not impacted because submitting messages like this using those submissions are not allowed (Graph, Outlook clients, SMTP AUTH Client Submission).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after the change starts rolling out to your environment, you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",

This includes specifying which Sensitive Information Types (SITs) are classified and what activities are collected on Windows endpoint devices.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=479760\" target=\"_blank\">479760</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-July 2025 (previously late June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><i>Key benefits of collection policies</i></p><ul><li>Granular control: Align with regulatory, regional, and organizational requirements that specify what types of data can be collected. \n</li><li>Noise reduction: Focus on the most relevant data security risks by tailoring data discovery and signals to what’s important for your organization \n</li></ul><p><i>Purview solutions impacted \n</i></p><ul><li>Unlike traditional Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies, collection policies are designed to streamline discovery of relevant information, rather than apply enforcement or take action on that information. There is no action taken from these policies to block content, as policies are meant to scope what content is collected and surfaces to administrators.</li><li>Using collection policies to scope signal collection will impact what is surfaced in several Purview solutions, including Insider Risk Management (IRM), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Activity Explorer, and more. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Overview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release. If you choose to leverage collection policies, admins can now choose which signals to discover in devices.\n</p><p>After you enable collection policies, you may see various updates to the Purview DLP audit experience. These updates may affect your organizations current configuration in the following ways: \n</p><ul><li>Activities to audit on your tenant will be scoped to the selected SITs and user activities \n</li><li>A new Location picker experience will be used to scope users and groups \n</li><li>To use collection policies for endpoints, the DLP <i>Always audit </i>setting will still need to be enabled. However, once created, collection policies for endpoint devices adjust from an open policy to an allowlisting policy that supports inclusion and/or exclusion of specific users, groups, and specified activities to reduce load and address customer requirements. \n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default for admins to configure.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release until you create an initial collection policy and <i>Always audit</i> is enabled in DLP (Windows endpoint devices only). To prepare for this upcoming enhancement to the Purview portal, we recommend you:</p><ul><li>Review Microsoft Learn docs on collection policies and required prerequisites: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Oerview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Help inform other Purview admins whose signal collection would be scoped, including the solutions in this message. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>We’ve made several usability improvements to enhance live captions and live transcripts in Microsoft Teams — making meetings more intuitive, less distracting, and more privacy-conscious.\n</p><p>First, live captions will be scrollable, allowing users to review the meeting conversation without interrupting the live view. To help protect sensitive content and support compliance with data handling policies, copying text from live captions is now disabled by default. This ensures captions remain a real-time experience, reducing the risk of content being copied and shared out of context.\n</p><p>Second, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will no longer open automatically for the user who starts recording, which also triggers transcription in the background. Before this rollout, this panel only auto-opens for the person who initiates recording or transcription — not for other participants — but this can be distracting and isn’t always relevant to the user's intent. After this rollout, the <i>Live transcript</i> panel will remain closed unless manually opened or the user explicitly starts transcription. This gives users more control over their meeting layout and helps avoid unnecessary screen changes during important discussions.\n</p><p>Third, when transcription is enabled, users who attempt to open the<i> Live transcript</i> panel will now see a banner suggesting they switch to live captions instead. This helps guide users to the most appropriate feature for following the conversation in real time, improving comprehension and reducing confusion.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, and Teams for the web. </p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=495454\" target=\"_blank\">495454</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early July 2025 and expect to complete by mid-July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC High): We will begin rolling out late July 2025 and expect to complete by early August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (DoD): We will begin rolling out early August 2025 and expect to complete by mid-August 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>These updates improve usability, privacy, and accessibility in Teams meetings.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit:</b>  In order to reduce the impact on customers, Microsoft has again decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in April 2026 for trial tenants and new tenants if the tenant is provisioned on/after April 1st, 2026. In April 2026, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In October 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all cloud hosted mailboxes in the WWMT environment including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Please note:</b> We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn) or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"> ________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in April 2026 (previously October 2025), Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><p>Phase 1 - Starting April 1, 2026, (previously October 2025) the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of trial tenants and all tenants created after this date.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 2 – Starting October 1, 2026, (previously April 2026) we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.&nbsp;</p><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Direct Send is a method used to send emails directly to a Microsoft Exchange Online customer’s hosted mailboxes from on-premises devices, applications, or third-party cloud services using the customer’s own accepted domain. It is an advanced method of sending messages to your users and requires proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to ensure messages are delivered successfully.</p><p>Many customers do not need to use Direct Send. Because SPF protections do not always outright block messages and sometimes deliver them to the Junk folder, it is possible for malicious senders mimicking Direct Send to have their messages that spoof your own domains land in the Junk folder and potentially confuse your users. Before this rollout, no feature existed to block Direct Send traffic for customers who have no need to use it. We will roll out the new <i>Reject Direct Send</i> setting for Exchange Online.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: Available now.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out early September 2025 and expect to complete by early September 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Direct Send covers anonymous messages sent from your own domain to your organization’s mailboxes and so enabling this setting will block any of that traffic. Direct Send traffic may include third-party services that you have given permission to use your domain or one of your own email applications hosted on-premises. To avoid having these messages rejected when this feature is enabled, they need to be authenticated. You can authenticate them by creating a <i>partner mail flow connector</i> for these messages.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout has happened automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update your relevant documentation.\n</p><p>By default, the new opt-in <code>RejectDirectSend</code> setting is set to <code>False</code>.  To enable the Reject Direct Send feature, Exchange Online admins can run this Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet: \n</p><p><code>Set-OrganizationConfig -RejectDirectSend $true</code>\n</p><p>The change should propagate out to your entire service within 30 minutes. With the feature enabled, any received Direct Send messages will see the following message:  \n</p><p><code>550 5.7.68 TenantInboundAttribution; Direct Send not allowed for this organization from unauthorized sources</code> \n</p><p>Unless you re-enable Direct Send, any messages that hit this error will need a partner connector created to authenticate their source as an approved sender.  \n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-more-control-over-direct-send-in-exchange-online/4408790\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing more control over Direct Send in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p><p>We invite Exchange admins to try out the feature and provide feedback that we can use to validate and proceed to offering this feature for General Availability.</p>",

Expect no further delays beyond this date. Please review the information below for more details.\n</p><p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) gradually beginning with a small percentage of submission rejections for all tenants on March 1st 2026 and reaching 100% rejections on April 30th 2026, (previously September 2025). After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>We will be making this change beginning March 1st, 2026, and completing April 30th, 2026 (previously September 2025).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center has been updated to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. Starting in July 2025, we will send monthly Message Center posts to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change.\n</p><p>Starting March 1st 2026 (previously September 2025) we will gradually start rejecting Basic Auth requests to the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints, increasing to 100% rejection by the end of the April 2026. \n</p><p>The Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints in scope for this change are:\n</p><p>•\tsmtp.office365.com\n</p><p>•\tsmtp-legacy.office365.com\n</p><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><p>•\t550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a>\n</p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before April 2026, previously September 2025:\n</p><p>•\tIf you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 6, 2025: Enforcement actions on unlicensed OneDrive accounts are ongoing. Please continue to monitor your <a href=\"http://spo.ms/admin#/oneDriveAccounts/management\" target=\"_blank\">Unlicensed OneDrive Account report</a>, as all accounts listed will be subject to enforcement if no action is taken.  To support more informed decision-making, we’ve introduced new and more granular reasons for why an account may appear unlicensed but and has not been deleted. This added detail should help you take the appropriate actions for each case and will be available in your Unlicensed OneDrive Accounts report no later than June 24th.  In some cases, admin action is required to delete the accounts. The timeline for enforcement remains unchanged from our last update.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The \"Manage what attendees see\" feature in Microsoft Teams helps organizers deliver polished events more easily by simplifying the attendee view and keeping the focus on participants who have been brought on screen. We’re introducing a new enhancement that gives organizers and presenters even more control over when shared content becomes visible to attendees.</p><p>Currently, when a presenter shares content, it is automatically displayed for attendees. With this update, shared content will first appear in the Manage screen’s left panel alongside other presenters. An organizer or presenter must manually bring it on screen, providing greater control over the attendee experience and preventing unintended interruptions.<br></p><p>Once shared content is brought on screen, the presenter sharing it will now see their content displayed instead of a text message indicating they are sharing.<br></p><p>Additionally, organizers and presenters joining from mobile will only see participants or content that has been brought on screen. Previously, users would see all organizers and presenters on their mobile devices.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/09ece2e5-3672-44e8-b0eb-0315d6e1108b\" style=\"width: 500px;\"><br></p><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Users joining through older Teams versions will continue to see the existing behavior, where shared content is automatically brought on screen.</li><li>PowerPoint Live will automatically be brought on screen and will not appear in the Manage screen panel.</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=483486\" target=\"_blank\">483486</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by mid-April 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Any new meetings or events created or updated after mid-April 2025 will receive the new improvements to the \"Manage what attendees see\" feature by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

After the split, the new tenant admin settings will be:</p><ul><li>Service principal access to global APIs: Controls access to \"global\" APIs that are not protected by any Fabric permission model, such as the creation of workspaces. This setting will retain the existing configuration and will be disabled by default. Setting name: <i>Service principals can create workspaces, connections, and deployment pipelines.</i></li><li>Service principal access to permission-based APIs: Controls access to APIs protected by the Fabric permission model, including managing existing workspaces and full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations for workspace sub-folders and items. This setting will adopt the existing configuration of the current setting and will be enabled by default. Setting name: <i>Service principals can call Fabric public APIs.</i></li></ul><p><b>Why are we introducing the change?\n</b></p><p>For years, one tenant admin setting has governed the access of service principals to public APIs in Microsoft Power BI and then in Microsoft Fabric overall (see screenshot of the current setting).\n</p><p>We originally introduced the single setting as a safeguard against potential misuse by multi-tenant app service principals, but as we have expanded into Fabric scenarios, we understand the need for a more flexible approach to unblock Fabric developers. When the current admin setting is set to disabled by default, developers are blocked.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/upcoming-changes-to-exchange-web-services-ews-api-for-office-365/ba-p/608055\" target=\"_blank\">we announced</a> that we were no longer making feature updates to Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Exchange Online, and we advised developers to move to Microsoft Graph. </p><p>In September 2023, we announced that on October 1, 2026, we will start blocking EWS requests to Exchange Online. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are now less than 18 months from October 1, 2026. We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>As we continue to enhance OneNote with a unified and modern experience, we want to remind you that OneNote for Windows 10 will reach end of support on October 14, 2025. To avoid disruptions, we strongly urge you to transition to OneNote on Windows (OneNote for Microsoft 365) and recommend uninstalling OneNote for Windows 10 as part of this process to avoid user confusion. This migration will ensure your team stay up to date with the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>OneNote for Windows 10 will reach end of support on October 14, 2025.</p><p>How this affects your organization:]</p><ul><li><b>Enhanced Security &amp; Compliance</b>: OneNote for Windows 10 will not receive new security features, such as Sensitivity Labeling, because it does not support Microsoft Information Protection (MIP). As a result, users still using OneNote for Windows 10 will be unable to access labeled content once labeling is enabled in OneNote.\n</li><li><b>Access to New Features &amp; AI-Powered Copilot</b>: OneNote on Windows (Microsoft 365) is our primary OneNote experience, with ongoing investments in AI-powered tools like Copilot to boost productivity. OneNote on Windows 10 no longer receives any new functionality.\n</li><li><b>Improved Performance &amp; Support</b>: OneNote for Windows 10 no longer receives updates or bug fixes, which may impact performance over time.\n</li><li><b>Enhanced Sync &amp; Collaboration</b>: OneNote for Microsoft 365 is continually improving sync and reliability. Starting in June 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 may experience changes to their sync behavior due to updates in security and services, which may require reopening notebooks to resume syncing. Additionally, the sync experience on OneNote for Windows 10 may be slower compared to OneNote on Windows.\n</li><li><b>A Smooth Transition Experience</b>: Starting in July 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 will receive in-app banner notifications guiding them to switch to OneNote for Microsoft 365 ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in their workflow.</li></ul><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>To help your users transition smoothly, we recommend starting the migration process now.

This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services.

With hotpatch updates, you can quickly take measures to help protect your organization from cyberattacks, while minimizing user disruptions. You’ll first create a hotpatch-enabled quality update policy in Windows Autopatch through the Microsoft Intune console. Eligible devices managed by this policy will be offered hotpatch updates in a quarterly cycle.

Devices receive the same level of security patching as the monthly standard security updates released on the second Tuesday of every month.

Please see the FAQ for more information.\n</li><li>Work or school search history on Bing.com will be available through March 31, 2025. Individuals who wish to keep their recent search history must download it by March 31 by signing in with their Entra ID, going to Options on Bing.com, and selecting “Search history.” There is no control available for IT admins to download search terms on behalf of users.\n</li><li>To help users on Bing.com, a banner to redirect to M365.cloud.microsoft will be shown in Edge if search terms are high likelihood of being work-related.

The last day of its availability is on March 31, 2025. This change is being made as we streamline search experiences and focus on enhancing core productivity tools.\n</p><p>The Microsoft Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box will continue to support work and school search, with some adjustments detailed below. \n</p><p>Details of the Change\n</p><p>After March 31, 2025, Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer be available, with changes as follows:\n</p><ul><li>Bing.com will no longer show work or school search results. Consequently, there will not be a dedicated page of work or school results and users’ work or school profiles will no longer appear on Bing.com. However, selecting the Work or School tab on Bing.com will redirect users to the new Microsoft Search experience on M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com).\n</li><li>Search boxes you’ve configured to point to Microsoft Search in Bing will no longer provide work or school results.\n</li><li>The Edge for Business address bar and Windows search box will continue to support work and school search with some adjustments, including:\n<ul><li>The Edge for Business address bar will no longer return work or school search results on a Bing.com page but will continue to provide suggested results in the address bar. In addition, the address bar will send users to work and school results on M365.cloud.microsoft rather than Bing.com. Users of the address bar can continue to find work-related documents, bookmarks, and people in suggested results—clicking on these suggestions takes users to work or school results on M365.cloud.microsoft. Users can also type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then input their work- or school-related query to get results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page. Work and school search results will include documents, people, and bookmarks. Work search for documents will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible.\n</li><li>The Windows search box will no longer display organization branding nor the “Work” or “School” tab but will continue to support work and school search. Search for documents and people remains available. will be available initially, with additional content types available as quickly as possible. With these changes, users will see some UX changes in the Windows search box.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p>As before, the core Microsoft Search experience remains accessible through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online.\n</p><ul><li>Additionally, Entra ID sign-in will no longer be available on Bing.com, since work and school search is no longer available on Bing.com.\n</li></ul><p>An FAQ and further details are now available at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ\" target=\"_blank\">Guidance for retiring Microsoft Search in Bing for your organization</a>, which will be updated regularly.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>The last day of availability of Microsoft Search in Bing is March 31, 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>For organizations using Microsoft Search in Bing, users will need to transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. \n</p><p>Users who are accustomed to using the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box can continue to conduct work searches through these endpoints entry points, with the expectation that there will be some adjustment in these experiences after the deprecation date. (For details on changes, please refer to the FAQ: https://aka.ms/MSBFAQ.)\n</p><p>Users who click on suggestions in the Edge for Business address bar or Windows search box may be redirected to Microsoft365.com before March 31, 2025. Also, as we begin testing the retirement experience, a small set of users may find before March 31 that Bing is intermittently unavailable as an entry point for work search. We recommend that you proactively inform your users of the change and direct them to M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. Adding M365.cloud.microsoft to their favorites or to the favorites bar in Edge for Business may be a helpful alternative pathway. \n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Customers should prepare to stop using Microsoft Search in Bing by March 31, 2025, and transition to using Microsoft Search through M365.cloud.microsoft (formerly Office.com and Microsoft365.com) and SharePoint Online. We recommend that you inform users about the upcoming change and the alternatives available. \n</p><p>Adding your preferred entry point from this set to favorites or favorites bar in Edge may be a helpful alternative pathway. Admins can easily set favorites in Edge for their organization, please see details here. \n</p><p>Additionally, users can continue to use the Edge for Business address bar and the Windows search box, with some changes expected. Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default. If you’d like to ensure that your users continue to have SafeSearch set to Strict after the Microsoft Search in Bing retirement, you can map www.bing.com to strict.bing.com at a network level.

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p><b>Next Steps:</b>\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>When an external network participant is invited to join a Microsoft Viva Engage external network, they receive an invitation email with an option to accept. Before this configuration change, all invited external users receive community conversations and emails, even if their invitation is in a pending or inactive state, allowing them to receive updates without completing registration. An E3/E5 license is required to use this feature.\n</p><p>After this change, pending or inactive users will no longer receive community conversations or emails unless they accept the invitation and complete the registration process. This change prioritizes active engagement, ensuring only registered users access conversation updates and reducing the volume of emails sent to non-registered users. External users who have activated their accounts will receive conversations and community emails.\n</p><p>We will begin rolling out this change early December 2024 and expected to complete by early January 2025. Extensions will not be provided for this configuration change.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>For organizations that frequently post in the Viva Engage external network expecting external recipients to engage via email without registering, this adjustment may impact their communication flow. However, we expect this effect to be minimal for most customers.\n</p><p>Pending users will need to actively accept their invitation by selecting the link in the invitation email or manually entering the URL in their browser to complete registration. After the user registers, they will begin to receive community conversations and emails.\n</p><p>An example of an invitation to join a Viva Engage external network:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/351fbd92-57ea-4ac9-8bd2-0568d2d98891\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user email\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This change will happen automatically by the specified date.

After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024.
